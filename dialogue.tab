hilltop_convince_9591ebe9	f	What do you mean, too dangerous?	game/convince.rpy	5
hilltop_convince_5a51bec3	f	Is this some kind of weird joke you're playing on me?	game/convince.rpy	6
hilltop_convince_af188c61	f	I can never really tell when you're joking, or when you really mean something.	game/convince.rpy	7
hilltop_convince_e00eea8b	f	Well, that might be fun after. But before we do that, I'm actually kind of hungry.	game/convince.rpy	11
hilltop_convince_44f61932	f	And you {i}did{/i} promise we'd meet somewhere for dinner tonight.	game/convince.rpy	12
hilltop_convince_fd71606d	f	So how about if we go for dinner first, and a drive after?	game/convince.rpy	13
hilltop_convince_1622aa3e	f	Deal!	game/convince.rpy	16
hilltop_convince_eb918e47	f	...What?	game/convince.rpy	21
hilltop_convince_c80b15b5	f	This is really not funny, if you're trying to make a joke.	game/convince.rpy	22
hilltop_convince_02ba90f8	f	Haha, nice.	game/convince.rpy	25
hilltop_convince_d50d252e	f	But seriously, where are we getting dinner?	game/convince.rpy	26
hilltop_convince_30fadd6d	f	Sounds good! See you at the Burger Shack!	game/convince.rpy	29
hilltop_convince_6899425c	f	Ooh, I've never had Thai! That sounds fun!	game/convince.rpy	35
hilltop_convince_ba6043d3	f	Hooray for taco-night!	game/convince.rpy	41
dinnerAnyway_afbf4212	f	Where do you want to meet, anyway?	game/convince.rpy	55
dinnerAnyway_30fadd6d	f	Sounds good! See you at the Burger Shack!	game/convince.rpy	58
dinnerAnyway_6899425c	f	Ooh, I've never had Thai! That sounds fun!	game/convince.rpy	64
dinnerAnyway_ba6043d3	f	Hooray for taco-night!	game/convince.rpy	70
tooDangerousForDinner_3e97b982	f	Is this some kind of weird death threat? What's going on? You're kind of starting to creep me out here.	game/convince.rpy	81
tooDangerousForDinner_5f633294	f	Okay...	game/convince.rpy	88
tooDangerousForDinner_472f52ec	f	You're kind of weirding me out here.	game/convince.rpy	89
tooDangerousForDinner_0ca136f1	f	Maybe we can talk about it once we meet?	game/convince.rpy	90
tooDangerousForDinner_dc1525ac	f	Okay, this is all pretty weird.	game/convince.rpy	92
tooDangerousForDinner_59bcd4f0	f	I mean - You seem pretty insistent that dinner tonight would be disastrous.	game/convince.rpy	93
tooDangerousForDinner_81422852	f	And I feel like I'd be an idiot to just ignore someone talking about me dying.	game/convince.rpy	94
tooDangerousForDinner_d2ed02dd	f	But this isn't the kind of thing that happens in real life, you know?	game/convince.rpy	95
tooDangerousForDinner_f349a7b7	f	Someone I've known for a while just coming up and telling me that I'm going to die tonight?	game/convince.rpy	96
tooDangerousForDinner_d7e6736e	f	I mean - What's going to happen? What makes you think I'm going to die?	game/convince.rpy	97
tooDangerousForDinner_31cd8257	f	We're going to dinner, for goodness sakes, not a war zone. What's the worst that can happen at a simple dinner?	game/convince.rpy	99
tooDangerousForDinner_2f61306f	f	Hah. You worry too much! That's {i}clearly{/i} not going to happen.	game/convince.rpy	117
tooDangerousForDinner_9b2df253	f	Where did you even come up with that? Have you just been sitting home today, coming up with things that could go wrong tonight?	game/convince.rpy	118
tooDangerousForDinner_57b28dc2	f	Lighten up! We're just having dinner! There's not a whole lot that can actually go wrong with dinner.	game/convince.rpy	120
tooDangerousForDinner_bb1efecc	f	Deal.	game/convince.rpy	125
tooDangerousForDinner_5da0f644	f	Okay. Let me turn it around then:\nWhat {i}can{/i} you do to convince me that going to dinner is a bad idea?	game/convince.rpy	128
tooDangerousForDinner_5403368e	f	Sitting here at home, after a completely near-death-experience-free-day, it's hard to imagine anything really bad happening like you're saying.	game/convince.rpy	129
tooDangerousForDinner_c7a1a60d	f	So what {i}can{/i} you say to make me believe you that actually I'm in terrible danger, and somehow you're the only one who knows anything about it?	game/convince.rpy	131
tooDangerousForDinner_d0c460bd	f	Yeah. That's kind of the problem I'm running into.	game/convince.rpy	134
tooDangerousForDinner_d806fd8a	f	I'm sorry. This is just all too weird for me.	game/convince.rpy	135
tooDangerousForDinner_678c4d3f	f	I guess you've successfully weirded me out, though.	game/convince.rpy	136
tooDangerousForDinner_6243d9fd	f	Do you mind if I just get dinner on my own? We can talk about this tomorrow.	game/convince.rpy	137
tooDangerousForDinner_065caad8	f	Don't worry. I'll watch out for [currentThreat].	game/convince.rpy	138
tooDangerousForDinner_5d27ce74		There is a click as she hangs up.	game/convince.rpy	139
tooDangerousForDinner_c375ec5d	f	I... Why would you even bring that up?	game/convince.rpy	144
tooDangerousForDinner_b94c25f0	f	And how do you even know about that?	game/convince.rpy	145
tooDangerousForDinner_d9b9038b	f	Have you been talking to Mom? Or stalking me or something?	game/convince.rpy	146
tooDangerousForDinner_4e528e1d	f	I'm not sure I'm comfortable with you digging around in my personal life like that.	game/convince.rpy	147
tooDangerousForDinner_c2acdecf	f	I think... I'm going to call off dinner tonight.	game/convince.rpy	148
tooDangerousForDinner_223f4d52	f	You've at least creeped me out enough to get out of dinner, at any rate.	game/convince.rpy	149
tooDangerousForDinner_49705a76	f	I'm going to go find something myself. We'll talk more tomorrow, I guess.	game/convince.rpy	150
tooDangerousForDinner_93d131ca	f	What? How would you know about that?	game/convince.rpy	153
tooDangerousForDinner_830e8b23	f	Oh god, have you somehow been reading my diary?	game/convince.rpy	154
tooDangerousForDinner_7bdb189e	f	Or are you some kind of creepy stalker or something?	game/convince.rpy	155
tooDangerousForDinner_22a957a7	f	Well, congratulations, I guess. You've convinced me that having dinner with you {i}is{/i} probably a bad idea.	game/convince.rpy	156
tooDangerousForDinner_db57a5a5	f	I... Yeah. We'll talk about this tomorrow, maybe. I can't deal with this right now.	game/convince.rpy	157
tooDangerousForDinner_d0775eaf	f	How would you even find out about that?	game/convince.rpy	160
tooDangerousForDinner_d15a0536	f	Did Mom tell you that or something? Why were you talking to Mom in the first place?	game/convince.rpy	161
tooDangerousForDinner_9c4dec7a	f	Or are those horrible pictures still around somewhere?	game/convince.rpy	162
tooDangerousForDinner_ce807a1f	f	Okay. I think you're right. We {i}shouldn't{/i} have dinner tonight.	game/convince.rpy	163
tooDangerousForDinner_898b9492	f	Don't worry, I'll keep an eye out for [currentThreat].	game/convince.rpy	164
saidMagicWord_33c6bd29	f	Why can't you tell me now?	game/convince.rpy	171
saidMagicWord_a04f0184	f	Wait.	game/convince.rpy	172
saidMagicWord_1f3f2540	f	How do you even {i}know{/i} about the local Hogwarts pickup stop?	game/convince.rpy	173
saidMagicWord_986bb84d	f	Are we talking about the same place?	game/convince.rpy	174
saidMagicWord_052837ea	f	I'm... hmm. Let me think. No, I'm {i}positive{/i} I never told anyone about that.	game/convince.rpy	175
saidMagicWord_0ffa008f	f	I didn't even write it in my diary.	game/convince.rpy	176
saidMagicWord_9cf4ea6b	f	There is literally {i}no way{/i} you could know about that.	game/convince.rpy	177
saidMagicWord_437682c7	f	That thing. That you just said.	game/convince.rpy	178
saidMagicWord_569eddac	f	It's not scientifically possible!	game/convince.rpy	179
saidMagicWord_f2d46393	f	YOU are not scientifically possible!	game/convince.rpy	180
saidMagicWord_3ec57d49	f	...	game/convince.rpy	181
saidMagicWord_13de18b6	f	But you've got me {i}really{/i} curious now.	game/convince.rpy	182
saidMagicWord_c12920f3	f	{i}Something{/i} weird is clearly going on around here. And it involves {i}my{/i} secret Hogwarts pickup stop, so I aim to get to the bottom of it.	game/convince.rpy	183
saidMagicWord_3ec57d49_1	f	...	game/convince.rpy	184
saidMagicWord_350f53d2	f	Okay, so here's what we'll do. I'll go to that spot now. You'll come and meet me there.	game/convince.rpy	185
saidMagicWord_6d0fdaa5	f	If we end up at the same spot, the spot which there is no {i}possible way{/i} you could know about, then you will have a lot of explaining to do.	game/convince.rpy	186
saidMagicWord_c677a7b1		There is a <<Click>> as the phone is hung up.	game/convince.rpy	187
randomPhrase_78ef9254		There is a pause, and the sound of someone rifling through the pages of a book.	game/convince.rpy	194
randomPhrase_9b70606d	f	Okay, I'll play along. I'm not sure what this will prove though.	game/convince.rpy	195
randomPhrase_6fa0db8e	f	I have a book here. I've just opened it up to a random page. Now what?	game/convince.rpy	196
randomPhrase_792e79cb	f	Okay... Are we doing some kind of fortune-cookie thing here?	game/convince.rpy	199
randomPhrase_77f8ff86	f	I'm on page... 144. The first sentence is {i}'What's 'pulling wobblers' mean?' he said'.{/i}	game/convince.rpy	200
randomPhrase_afa768d2	f	Not sure what that says about our future, but there it is.	game/convince.rpy	201
randomPhrase_c8e9faa2	f	So... Now what?	game/convince.rpy	203
randomPhrase_ac0ff955	f	Actually, I think I know what. I think I'm going to go have dinner.	game/convince.rpy	204
randomPhrase_e18a69f1	f	I think you've successfully convinced me that we shouldn't have dinner together.	game/convince.rpy	205
randomPhrase_ae9c5b7d	f	I'm just too weirded out now.	game/convince.rpy	206
randomPhrase_9d8b6304	f	We'll talk about this later, I guess. This has all been very strange.	game/convince.rpy	207
randomPhrase_5f633294	f	Okay...	game/convince.rpy	212
randomPhrase_5cfce78b	f	This whole conversation has been...	game/convince.rpy	213
randomPhrase_031b821f	f	Disquieting.	game/convince.rpy	214
randomPhrase_7bd5265b	f	You know what? I think maybe you're right.	game/convince.rpy	215
randomPhrase_77387115	f	I'm going to skip out tonight, and go grab dinner myself, I think.	game/convince.rpy	216
randomPhrase_a33aafd1	f	Don't worry, I'll try to make sure to stay away from [currentThreat].	game/convince.rpy	217
randomPhrase_5371d300		There is stunned silence for a moment.	game/convince.rpy	221
randomPhrase_3e868c43	f	How did you...	game/convince.rpy	222
randomPhrase_ec20a2c8	f	Are you... looking into my room somehow?	game/convince.rpy	223
randomPhrase_cdbd97ab	f	That's... that's really not cool, okay?	game/convince.rpy	224
randomPhrase_e8b51724	f	Really not cool.	game/convince.rpy	225
randomPhrase_2ca5d5cd	f	I think we're done here. I am not having dinner with a weirdo stalker.	game/convince.rpy	226
randomPhrase_7db86dfb	f	Good night.	game/convince.rpy	227
wentOnHerOwn_7e189477		After a few moments, there is the sound of an airplane, getting closer and closer, followed by one of the loudest noises you have ever heard.	game/convince.rpy	235
wentOnHerOwn_3732626c		The TV in the background switches to an emergency report about the plane crash and fires that are happening right now.	game/convince.rpy	236
wentOnHerOwn_c36f6bf1		Even before the news confirms it, though, you have a pretty good idea exactly who the plane crashed on top of.	game/convince.rpy	238
wentOnHerOwn_fd8d239e		{size=+10}~The End~{/size}\n\nYou didn't even get to have a date, and it still ended in disaster.	game/convince.rpy	241
hilltopConversationRoot_ab30e589		In the night's stillness, the sound of gunshots is quite clear, even from far away.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	33
hilltopConversationRoot_0212b508		Several blinking police lights appear and trace their way towards the Burger Shack.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	34
hilltopConversationRoot_d77229eb		Just as they start to arrive, there is a bright flash and another loud noise. The Burger Shack now seems to be very much on fire.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	35
hilltopConversationRoot_f088d8b4	f	You know, I had been thinking about asking if you wanted to do burgers tonight.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	36
hilltopConversationRoot_b7dfb263	f	Guess I can see how {i}that{/i} would have turned out.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	37
hilltopConversationRoot_bebb406f		For a moment, neither of you can really see anything amiss, but then a motion catches your eye. Felicia obviously sees it too.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	41
hilltopConversationRoot_1d5ffec2		At first it just looks like shadows flowing from rooftop to rooftop.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	42
hilltopConversationRoot_4f893410	f	What are... are those... ninjas?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	43
hilltopConversationRoot_96a20e18	f	Wow.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	46
hilltopConversationRoot_287de5cf		She squints.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	48
hilltopConversationRoot_08b401f4	f	Yeah, I'm pretty sure those are ninjas.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	49
hilltopConversationRoot_a9f86f6a	f	But... That's stupid. Ninjas are Japanese. Why would they show up at a Thai restaurant?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	51
hilltopConversationRoot_68a49215	f	This game of yours is kind of absurd, you know?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	52
hilltopConversationRoot_d99772d5		The ninjas leap from rooftop to rooftop, almost eerie in the fluidity of their motion.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	53
hilltopConversationRoot_510f0cab		When they reach the roof of the Thai restaurant, they regroup, and then, in one smooth movement, flip over the roof and into the windows.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	54
hilltopConversationRoot_ce5083cb		The faint sound of yelling reaches you atop the hill.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	55
hilltopConversationRoot_2ac5f618		She looks out toward the water. After a moment, she gives a small gasp.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	58
hilltopConversationRoot_e4d2ec6c		The Taco Palace is covered in motion. At first it's difficult to tell exactly what is going on, but then your brain starts to piece together what you're seeing.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	59
hilltopConversationRoot_73fefbc0		The entire building is covered in tentacles, livid green in the harsh illumination of the outdoor lamps.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	60
hilltopConversationRoot_4f27f3a5		From the thrashing of the water, it is clear that they are attached to something truly massive.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	61
hilltopConversationRoot_5b2c467d		It never becomes visible, though - Instead, the Taco Palace's supports buckle, and with a groan, the whole building is pulled into the churning water.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	62
hilltopConversationRoot_e2a28fdc		Felicia is quiet, watching it sink under the waves.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	63
hilltopConversationRoot_1861a3a7	f	You know, I never thought I'd say this, but some of these ways I apparently die are straight out of B-movies.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	64
hilltopConversationRoot_23ff239f	f	Okay! I confess a certain amount of interest in the topic. Where do you want to start?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	67
hilltopConversationRoot_18d9a9aa	f	Hah. That's a pretty big question.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	74
hilltopConversationRoot_dc74a7a0	f	I assume you mean about the game you're playing, but you have to admit, game or no game, it's the right kind of question to be pondering on a hilltop, watching shooting stars.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	76
hilltopConversationRoot_2cd343c1	f	I assume you mean about the game you're playing, but you have to admit, game or no game, it's the right kind of question to be pondering on a hilltop, looking up at the stars.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	78
hilltopConversationRoot_1b8ddabc	f	Heck, I can't see the game. I mean, I see the absurd things that have been going on tonight. And your explanation rings true and all.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	79
hilltopConversationRoot_b996e7a6	f	But from my point of view, I'm not in a game. And it's still a good question.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	80
hilltopConversationRoot_13c7b430	f	Maybe the answers are the same?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	81
hilltopConversationRoot_109d0490	f	You're basically asking 'why do bad things happen', right? That's something people have been asking since forever.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	82
hilltopConversationRoot_91f4c074	f	Yeah, that would be kind of a tall order. So maybe that's not what this game is about.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	85
hilltopConversationRoot_de72f33b	f	That question might just be tangential to whatever the author is trying to tell you.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	86
hilltopConversationRoot_83c724dd	f	So maybe we're not asking the right question, then.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	87
hilltopConversationRoot_36fd60a3	f	Yeah, I guess they do, don't they?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	89
hilltopConversationRoot_56ec807c	f	Maybe we're asking the wrong question, then.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	90
hilltopConversationRoot_e4de7666	f	After all, the game is clearly about {i}something{/i}.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	91
hilltopConversationRoot_ca3b7eef	f	I don't know what the game looks like from your end, but from mine, well...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	92
hilltopConversationRoot_1b8b77df	f	I can't see anyone going through the trouble of making a game as weird as this, without having {i}something{/i} on their mind that they wanted to say.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	93
hilltopConversationRoot_96b819e4	f	Say - What does the game look like, anyway? To me, it just looks like, you know, life. What's it like for you?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	94
hilltopConversationRoot_e249b7f3	f	Oh. That sounds pretty low-budget.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	97
hilltopConversationRoot_90b667e9	f	That's too bad. If I'm not actually real, and my whole existence is actually a lie, and all that, it would be nice to at least know it was a high-budget lie with nice graphics.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	98
hilltopConversationRoot_1dc00bc1	f	Okay, this time I know you're pulling my leg. I'm old enough to remember 'Blast Processing' too, you know.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	100
hilltopConversationRoot_2ab6efee	f	WHAT? HOW DARE YOU MAKE FUN OF MY GAME.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	102
hilltopConversationRoot_062037c6	f	SEE HOW CRAPPY IT IS ONCE I DELETE ALL YOUR SAVE GAMES!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	103
hilltopConversationRoot_44f93b05	f	DELETING...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	104
hilltopConversationRoot_6d158f71	f	Ahaha, was that convincing?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	105
hilltopConversationRoot_1a27d636	f	Although... Now I'm wondering... Did I just say that because I thought it would be funny?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	106
hilltopConversationRoot_c1d256ab	f	Or because an all-powerful disgruntled game author wrote me to {i}want{/i} to do it, and then made me try to explain it away as me just making a joke?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	107
hilltopConversationRoot_80f96e03	f	And while we're going down the rabbit hole - did they then decide to lampshade the whole thing by making me wonder this?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	108
hilltopConversationRoot_71c06a31	f	...If this {i}is{/i} all a game, then the person who wrote it seems kind of odd in the head.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	109
hilltopConversationRoot_5d6fe7c8	f	Hey! That's kind of a personal question!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	113
hilltopConversationRoot_8f6c5e0e		She giggles.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	114
hilltopConversationRoot_067a0afc	f	I don't know. I'm not really sure how to answer that.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	115
hilltopConversationRoot_49acf673	f	I mean, I haven't exactly been kicking over tombstones or tripping old gypsy ladies or anything lately.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	116
hilltopConversationRoot_1b791e7b	f	I can honestly say that this is a bit outside my experience. So I don't really have any idea why it keeps happening.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	117
hilltopConversationRoot_2b3822ee	f	How would you even go about diagnosing something like that?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	118
hilltopConversationRoot_4e37ca0b	f	"Excuse me doctor, but can you tell me why I'm doomed?"	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	119
hilltopConversationRoot_c936e81c	f	I mean, I don't know. Let's think about this. How does it usually work in video games?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	120
hilltopConversationRoot_b9ee21d0	f	Maybe I'm just supposed to die a tragic death, like Aeris or something.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	121
hilltopConversationRoot_e7ed78e7	f	Oh come on, that game is nearly old enough to vote.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	126
hilltopConversationRoot_fdff9c3b	f	The statute of limitations is {i}clearly{/i} up on that one.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	127
hilltopConversationRoot_b3ea9949	f	Wait, seriously?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	129
hilltopConversationRoot_9c8dac71	f	You never played Final Fantasy 7?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	130
hilltopConversationRoot_48e7493d	f	I'm not sure if we can be friends any more.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	131
hilltopConversationRoot_3461f207	f	Well, anyway, she was a character in a game. She died, and everyone got really upset.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	132
hilltopConversationRoot_2b38c8c3	f	Because, you know, it was kind of out of the blue. Back then, games usually only killed side characters. Not core party-members that you'd had time to become invested in.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	133
hilltopConversationRoot_167c04da	f	A lot of fans didn't take it well. They didn't like losing her, and didn't like realizing that there was absolutely nothing you could do to save her.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	134
hilltopConversationRoot_b8a1d003	f	Anyway, maybe it's like that. I'm supposed to die in order to, you know, embolden you! Strengthen your resolve, so you can complete your epic quest!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	135
hilltopConversationRoot_fcc824d7	f	Hehe.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	136
hilltopConversationRoot_4a58287c	f	But on the other hand, if the game always ends right after I die, and if there are a bunch of ways I can die, then that does seem to imply that you're supposed to find a way to avoid it.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	137
hilltopConversationRoot_dcb53f2b		She seems lost in thought for a moment, watching the falling stars streak across the sky.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	139
hilltopConversationRoot_7e7049a8		She seems lost in thought for a moment.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	141
hilltopConversationRoot_502a71f5	f	I suppose... I guess, don't take this the wrong way, but...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	142
hilltopConversationRoot_7526fa4e	f	You could say I keep dying because of you.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	143
hilltopConversationRoot_a624df83	f	But...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	144
hilltopConversationRoot_9ddd14ea	f	On one hand, you could say I keep dying because we haven't figured out how to save me yet.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	145
hilltopConversationRoot_28005685	f	But on a deeper level... You could say that I keep dying because you keep playing.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	146
hilltopConversationRoot_8647dac0	f	For example, if you'd stopped after the first time I died, then I would have only died once.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	147
hilltopConversationRoot_b21046b0	f	I'm not saying that's preferable. But what would happen to me, to the world, if you just stopped playing?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	148
hilltopConversationRoot_3183da96	f	Would I stay dead? What if you quit the game before I died?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	149
hilltopConversationRoot_ba792713	f	What happens to characters in a story, if the storyteller stops before he's done?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	150
hilltopConversationRoot_7a07e692		She falls silent again, watching the shooting stars.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	152
hilltopConversationRoot_8b26ec40		She falls silent again, lost in thought.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	154
hilltopConversationRoot_e5634d5e	f	I don't know. I mean, you've done a reasonable job so far, right?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	159
hilltopConversationRoot_e704f663	f	Apparently you've saved me from a lot of things that might have happened.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	160
hilltopConversationRoot_65c1d956	f	So I guess you're doing okay so far.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	161
hilltopConversationRoot_69116a47	f	Cheer up! You've managed to put off losing for a while.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	164
hilltopConversationRoot_189766cc	f	How hard can it be to come up with a way to win?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	165
hilltopConversationRoot_ae8be902	f	You'll figure it out. You got this far, right?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	167
hilltopConversationRoot_645e517f	f	I wish I could be more help. I feel like I haven't been very helpful so far, except for occasionally following instructions to not die.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	168
hilltopConversationRoot_e2d2e3ba	f	I guess if this really is all a video game, and I'm a character in it, and the game wants me dead, then I probably won't be allowed to just hand you the answer.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	169
hilltopConversationRoot_3ec57d49	f	...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	170
hilltopConversationRoot_5030fe8a	f	Hehehe.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	171
hilltopConversationRoot_4f42672d	f	If this is a video game, and you're spending all of your time trying to save me, I wonder if that means it will get blasted for promoting unfortunate gender stereotypes.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	172
hilltopConversationRoot_e104596f	f	"Yet another helpless video game girl to rescue! Why can't we advance the medium beyond these stone-age stereotypes, which always treat women as mere objects to be rescued!"	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	173
hilltopConversationRoot_9607574b	f	That would serve the author right.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	174
hilltopConversationRoot_d7d4b3d0	f	Hmm. That's true, I guess.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	176
hilltopConversationRoot_e505cb79	f	Although I guess one question I have is - what do you mean, 'win'?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	177
hilltopConversationRoot_da8c1585	f	What would winning a game like this mean?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	178
hilltopConversationRoot_2b807fbd	f	What exactly are you looking to get out of this?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	179
hilltopConversationRoot_302f7d8f	f	Are you really just waiting for the game to pat you on the head, and say 'Well done, you finally did the right thing?'	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	187
hilltopConversationRoot_a4342cc3	f	Hmm.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	188
hilltopConversationRoot_865e8f05	f	Well, how about this. I'm part of the game, right?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	189
hilltopConversationRoot_b718643b	f	Can I do it?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	190
hilltopConversationRoot_9b234044	f	Here -	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	191
hilltopConversationRoot_000a1142	f	Congratulations! A winner is you! You have beaten the game! Well done!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	192
hilltopConversationRoot_ef95d6ba	f	I assume that made the message you were looking for show up on your screen.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	193
hilltopConversationRoot_6bf60afe	f	Does that count?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	195
hilltopConversationRoot_13d77dcb	f	Awesome! Glad I could help!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	198
hilltopConversationRoot_a7819760	f	....	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	199
hilltopConversationRoot_152e2c5f	f	I'm still totally going to die from aliens, aren't I?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	201
hilltopConversationRoot_681b785a	f	I'm still totally going to die in a few minutes, aren't I?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	203
hilltopConversationRoot_782ca896	f	I'll believe my happy ending when I see it.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	206
hilltopConversationRoot_577282c7	f	Figures.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	208
hilltopConversationRoot_b4dcdbd4	f	That's too bad.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	210
hilltopConversationRoot_401d8743	f	I guess I'm not 'official' enough or something?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	211
hilltopConversationRoot_3502da92	f	I'd go grab my top-hat and monocle, but I doubt I have time, at this point.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	212
hilltopConversationRoot_48a2c4af	f	So...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	213
hilltopConversationRoot_0da3decb	f	You seem convinced that it's even possible to 'win' this game.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	214
hilltopConversationRoot_1b3be626	f	How do you know that a 'good ending' even exists?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	215
hilltopConversationRoot_06d3a9d7	f	Yeah, maybe. Although, not all books end happily. Maybe not all games do either?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	218
hilltopConversationRoot_8e18fb3a	f	That does seem like a weird game to make though. A happy start to a day, and then just everything ending badly, no matter what you do.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	219
hilltopConversationRoot_c11dccf0	f	I guess it could be a commentary on the pointlessness of life, and oh, the sadness, everything will die, woe is me.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	220
hilltopConversationRoot_67e08710	f	But if I had to rate my life so far, or even my day so far, it doesn't {i}feel{/i} like a goth emo game of darkness and howling void.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	221
hilltopConversationRoot_0ab1eb28	f	I don't know. I don't pretend to know what this is all about, but from what you've told me, and what I've seen, I don't think it's as simple as that.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	222
hilltopConversationRoot_17ce54a9	f	But I don't think the author is just saying, 'Ha ha, you played my game with no ending for however long, you wasted your time, L-O-L'.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	223
hilltopConversationRoot_dfabef7a	f	Hmm. That's usually true, I guess.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	225
hilltopConversationRoot_0e61f9ad	f	I wonder if the author of the game agrees with you?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	226
hilltopConversationRoot_b41103bc	f	I guess you could make a puzzle that was missing a piece or something, if you were trying to make a statement.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	227
hilltopConversationRoot_1a70273d	f	Like a box of jigsaw pieces, missing a single piece, as a pretentious art installation.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	228
hilltopConversationRoot_16aefd88	f	I don't know - does this game feel pretentious to you?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	229
hilltopConversationRoot_62acbb94	f	Maybe that's not it then.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	232
hilltopConversationRoot_d8f1fd97	f	Hmm. Could be, then.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	234
hilltopConversationRoot_c77ce477	f	Maybe that's it, then. Maybe it's just there to make a statement for the sake of being a statement?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	236
hilltopConversationRoot_5b054dbc	f	That does seem like an odd way to go about it, though...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	237
hilltopConversationRoot_9ad7f685		She leans back and goes quiet for a moment.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	239
hilltopConversationRoot_47e723f5		She leans back and looks up at all the shooting stars, lost in thought.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	241
hilltopConversationRoot_fdc2277b	f	Although... I guess if you have a box full of jigsaw pieces, and you're missing a piece...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	242
hilltopConversationRoot_e049e785	f	The message might just be... "Look outside the box..."	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	243
hilltopConversationRoot_026f37ee	f	I'm not sure.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	245
hilltopConversationRoot_0db46e77	f	Maybe to see how long you'll look for one?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	246
hilltopConversationRoot_52b58bfc	f	Or to bring attention to the idea that not all mazes {i}have{/i} exits?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	247
hilltopConversationRoot_297e70bc	f	Or maybe it's just to force you to pick for yourself where you want to stop, rather than pointing to a spot and telling you that it's where you should try to go?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	248
hilltopConversationRoot_9ae3eefd	f	Well, according to you, what you're missing is the answer to a puzzle.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	252
hilltopConversationRoot_2f24360c	f	Although, if you want my opinion, I think you might also be missing a clear idea of exactly what it will look like when you find it.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	253
hilltopConversationRoot_5aefe8dd	f	But let's think through it.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	254
hilltopConversationRoot_cf31b99f	f	You've gotten this far by saving and loading your games to make sure that you never make mistakes, right?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	255
hilltopConversationRoot_699782ec	f	But now you're worried that there might not actually {i}be{/i} a choice you can make that leads to what you want?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	257
hilltopConversationRoot_1f05e810	f	Are you worrying now that I'll die anyway, no matter what choices you make?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	259
hilltopConversationRoot_acb0b47c	f	If you've reached the end of what you can accomplish with good choices, then all that's left are bad choices, right?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	260
hilltopConversationRoot_871649c0	f	What else can you do, right? If your choices are all bad ones, then you either have to pick one anyway... or stop playing by the game's rules.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	261
hilltopConversationRoot_261d1685		She nervously fiddles with her hat for a moment.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	263
hilltopConversationRoot_0080d686	f	Did you ever see the movie {i}Groundhog Day{/i}, with Bill whats-his-name? Murney? Murray? Bill Murray, I think.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	264
hilltopConversationRoot_90bd363d	f	Oh, cool. Wasn't that a great movie?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	267
hilltopConversationRoot_c6ab3a05	f	Anyway, I'm just thinking about how that movie ended.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	268
hilltopConversationRoot_be900220	f	What?!? But... it's like the best existential comedy ever!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	270
hilltopConversationRoot_4b67cb56	f	You should totally see it!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	271
hilltopConversationRoot_e29c808a	f	But anyway, it was about a guy who's a total jerk to everyone, and then he has this day, Groundhog Day, where he can't get out.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	272
hilltopConversationRoot_4cf077a4	f	Like, every morning, no matter what he does during the day, he wakes up, and it's Groundhog Day again.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	273
hilltopConversationRoot_26dd2262	f	And at first he's like 'this sucks' and sulks a lot.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	274
hilltopConversationRoot_bfa984ce	f	And then he's like 'this is awesome!' and uses his knowledge of how the day will go to totally mess with everyone.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	275
hilltopConversationRoot_0cf6b8af	f	Like by the end he's learned everything about everyone in town, and can surprise people with things like 'Hey, how's your novel coming?'	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	276
hilltopConversationRoot_e88c3e1a	f	And they're all confused, since they never told him about it. Except they did, last time he replayed the day.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	277
hilltopConversationRoot_17cce506	f	Except then, he goes back to 'this sucks', because he is still stuck in the same day forever, with people who he knows intimately now, but who never remember him each morning when it resets.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	278
hilltopConversationRoot_7bd6546e	f	He kept doing all the things with the townsfolk, and making changes. But ultimately, he couldn't get out until he changed himself in some way.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	279
hilltopConversationRoot_fa821f53	f	I wonder if this is sort of like that?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	280
hilltopConversationRoot_4c65a8c2	f	Obviously it isn't a perfect analogy. But maybe the choice you need to make to 'win' isn't something that you can {i}do{/i}, but rather something you have to {i}be{/i}?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	281
hilltopConversationRoot_4b4946a5	f	I assume it's hard because it's trying to tell one of us something.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	286
hilltopConversationRoot_7a6c55b6	f	Although, I guess the other option is just that you're bad at games.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	287
hilltopConversationRoot_78007235	f	But it sounds like you've already made it a ways in this one, if you've averted my death multiple times already.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	288
hilltopConversationRoot_c4a4bab2	f	Maybe the problem is just that you're looking for the wrong thing?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	289
hilltopConversationRoot_d43a81e4	f	You got this far by saving and reloading away all of the mistakes until you had a day where you had done everything perfectly, right?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	290
hilltopConversationRoot_aa5c2cee	f	And now we're here.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	291
hilltopConversationRoot_e5ffd577		She gestures up at the sky, still covered in shooting stars.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	293
hilltopConversationRoot_079c19ce	f	Which, honestly, is still kind of perfect, in its own way.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	294
hilltopConversationRoot_c52adf04		She makes a vague gesture at the starry expanse over your heads.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	296
hilltopConversationRoot_09aa5b9c	f	And it's still kind of perfect, honestly.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	297
hilltopConversationRoot_139bede8	f	Even knowing that I'm... Probably going to die soon. It's still kind of magical.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	299
hilltopConversationRoot_ca80e5f5		She's quiet for a moment.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	300
hilltopConversationRoot_22fbdc7b	f	This actually reminds me of a different game, now that I think of it.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	301
hilltopConversationRoot_19275503	f	Did you ever play {i}Chrono Trigger{/i}, back on the Super Nintendo?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	303
hilltopConversationRoot_f4b27cfa	f	Yeah, wasn't that game great? It had that ending, though, that reminds me of this.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	306
hilltopConversationRoot_7c1eecae	f	Do you remember how that game ended, if you died?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	307
hilltopConversationRoot_73068639	f	Ahh, it was a great game. It was about some kids who build a time machine, see. And they go to the future, and discover that the world is doomed.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	310
hilltopConversationRoot_7634ee90	f	It's all going to be eaten up by this giant alien, and everyone is miserable or dead.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	311
hilltopConversationRoot_0a2785c0	f	So most of the game is you, playing the kids, bouncing around through time, trying to figure out what they have to do to change the future, so that it doesn't end up all awful.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	312
hilltopConversationRoot_3896fec4	f	It had an ending, though, that reminds me a lot of this.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	313
hilltopConversationRoot_6428c9bc	f	Whenever you hit a game over, it would show you the world of the future, right as the disaster hit.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	314
hilltopConversationRoot_30ca8b38	f	Explosions spread across it, and you saw the planet from space, slowly turning grey.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	315
hilltopConversationRoot_cff1874a	f	And then it had this horrible alien sound, and words appeared, saying 'But... the Future Refused to Change.'	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	316
hilltopConversationRoot_2d01e504	f	Gave me chills as a kid, honestly. Was way more powerful than just a generic 'game over' screen.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	317
hilltopConversationRoot_44d0aed4	f	Anyway, I was just reminded of it because... Yeah. All of this.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	318
hilltopConversationRoot_e3ebaf4b	f	You're basically trying to do the same thing - fix the bad future that you know is coming.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	319
hilltopConversationRoot_b3b32bc1	f	But it keeps refusing to budge.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	320
hilltopConversationRoot_5e0a1f42	f	I'm not sure what to suggest. If you were playing Chrono Trigger, you could go punch an alien until the future got better.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	321
hilltopConversationRoot_e79e15ae	f	That solution might not be applicable to this problem, though.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	322
hilltopConversationRoot_06398373		She sighs.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	324
hilltopConversationRoot_593d439b	f	That was such a good game.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	325
hilltopConversationRoot_60634ff3	f	You should really play that game sometime. It was really good.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	327
hilltopConversationRoot_d952edd4	f	Oh. Okay. More cheating death, I assume?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	333
hilltopConversationRoot_534fd462	f	[prompt]	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	338
hilltopConversationRoot_b3ea9949_1	f	Wait, seriously?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	341
hilltopConversationRoot_d38828f2	f	Is it just me, or are these deaths getting more and more improbable?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	342
hilltopConversationRoot_73f6c91c	f	Wait, you're serious?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	344
hilltopConversationRoot_d38828f2_1	f	Is it just me, or are these deaths getting more and more improbable?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	345
hilltopConversationRoot_8a8f4b3d	f	Fine. Keep me in suspense. See if I care.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	347
hilltopConversationRoot_b668d6f8		She moves over to the opposite side of the bench.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	348
hilltopConversationRoot_fd7ac897	f	So if that death is averted, what kills me after that? Or am I in the clear?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	351
hilltopConversationRoot_8b7d6aeb	f	Oh, exciting!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	354
hilltopConversationRoot_3ec57d49_1	f	...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	355
hilltopConversationRoot_384d9d16	f	But, given that I've already died several times today, you'll understand if I remain a bit on edge.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	356
hilltopConversationRoot_3f8ed06e	f	Yes, because that sounds entirely in keeping with how the rest of this day has gone.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	358
hilltopConversationRoot_50ef902b	f	Seriously. Don't try to sugarcoat this for me. This is messed up enough as it is.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	359
hilltopConversationRoot_444e6931	f	If I'm going to die again, I'd rather you just flat-out tell me.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	360
hilltopConversationRoot_56046258	f	So, seriously. What do I have to look forward to this time?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	361
hilltopConversationRoot_577282c7_1	f	Figures.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	364
hilltopConversationRoot_e73a40df	f	I assume that's when the space aliens show up?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	368
hilltopConversationRoot_123d3610	f	Why do I get the feeling that whoever wrote this whole scenario has stopped taking anything seriously?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	369
hilltopConversationRoot_e672f0a7	f	So what gets me next time?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	371
hilltopConversationRoot_93605a32	f	Well, guess we'll find out, then.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	374
hilltopConversationRoot_8e257e41	f	Personally, I'm still hoping for a happy ending, but today does not seem to be my day for that.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	375
hilltopConversationRoot_9cedb894	f	Fine. Suit yourself, I guess. I'll find out either way.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	377
hilltopConversationRoot_d82ee8f1	f	But I'd feel better knowing about what's coming.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	378
hilltopConversationRoot_59aa2090	f	Erm. Aliens?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	383
hilltopConversationRoot_313aca05	f	Like from... Across the border? ... Or...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	384
hilltopConversationRoot_3b8de8fd	f	The space kind? For real? You're serious?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	385
hilltopConversationRoot_97d5b453	f	This day just keeps getting less and less plausible.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	386
hilltopConversationRoot_8a696692	f	Okay, so there will be space aliens. What comes after that?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	387
hilltopConversationRoot_cecab0f9	f	Got it. One thing at a time, I guess.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	390
hilltopConversationRoot_89d9f5b2	f	I wouldn't mind one of those.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	392
hilltopConversationRoot_485979e5	f	Right. If you've already found that, then why are you back here, reliving meteors and alien invasions?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	394
hilltopConversationRoot_d184a121		For a few minutes, you just ignore everything, and watch the spectacle taking place in the sky above you.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	399
hilltopConversationRoot_79384ae4		You have to admit it really is rather breathtaking.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	400
hilltopConversationRoot_553ce1df		It's like watching fireworks, except that there is no beginning, and no end. Just a constant stream of fire across the night sky.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	401
hilltopConversationRoot_3df6b312		Felicia is the first to break the silence.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	402
hilltopConversationRoot_1edb774a	f	Have you ever thought about how stories work?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	403
hilltopConversationRoot_7e6d461b	f	Yeah. Me too. I used to be really obsessive over them.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	406
hilltopConversationRoot_87c497ac	f	Like what makes one work. What separates a story from, I don't know, dry facts or something.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	407
hilltopConversationRoot_4e982175	f	Oh cool! Me too! I used to think about them all the time.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	409
hilltopConversationRoot_6e95c7d1	f	Not about particular stories, but about how they work as a medium, and why we love them so much.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	410
hilltopConversationRoot_cc43b430	f	Oh. I think about stories a lot. What I'd do if I was in one. Whether or not I'm in one right now. That kind of thing.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	412
hilltopConversationRoot_cbb2e1dc	f	Of course, after tonight, well. Games are probably close enough.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	413
hilltopConversationRoot_8594fb72	f	Have you ever thought about where a story lives? Like where it, I don't know how to really say this... where it {i}exists?{/i}	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	414
hilltopConversationRoot_840afa42	f	I used to think that stories lived in, you know, books. Or in the mind of the person telling the story. Or whatever.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	415
hilltopConversationRoot_8f8e75c9	f	But I think stories live in the brain of whoever's listening to it.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	416
hilltopConversationRoot_e14ea5d6	f	When someone tells us a story, we go along with whatever they say. Because that's the easiest thing to do.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	417
hilltopConversationRoot_cd0bf771	f	But what if they stopped telling us what to do?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	418
hilltopConversationRoot_4efee029	f	What if someone told you a story, and then stopped before telling you how it ends? Is the story dead forever? Doomed to be forever unfinished?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	419
hilltopConversationRoot_276e4a5d	f	What if you like the story and {i}want{/i} an ending? Even if you didn't start it, are you allowed to finish it yourself?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	420
hilltopConversationRoot_3af987d4	f	It's in your head at that point, right? You can do whatever you want with it. Who's going to stop you?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	421
hilltopConversationRoot_0492cdc4	f	And then... What if they {i}did{/i} finish telling you the story... But you just didn't like how it ended?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	422
hilltopConversationRoot_5273a84c	f	What if you just... decided that it ended a different way than they said?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	423
hilltopConversationRoot_a2de1f50	f	The very act of storytelling is itself a deeply collaborative activity, right?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	424
hilltopConversationRoot_cf5ad53d	f	They have to tell a story. And you have to play it out in your mind while they tell you. That's how it works, right?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	425
hilltopConversationRoot_c25b19c7	f	What would happen if the audience rebelled? And played a different story in their minds than the one that was being told? Would that story be any less valid or real?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	427
hilltopConversationRoot_ea5affdd	f	Well, obviously I {i}can{/i}. I guess your point is that I shouldn't.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	430
hilltopConversationRoot_3971e912	f	By whose rules though?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	431
hilltopConversationRoot_518b5c71	f	Maybe the storyteller isn't really the ultimate authority. Maybe they're just making suggestions and hoping that people follow them.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	432
hilltopConversationRoot_44c32c6e	f	Sure. It's the 'official' ending. The one that anyone else who's heard the same story will count as the end.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	434
hilltopConversationRoot_f9ca6625	f	But that doesn't mean it has to be the ending I choose.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	435
hilltopConversationRoot_63ed49cf	f	Well, aren't you already doing that?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	437
hilltopConversationRoot_9b698411	f	Every time you reloaded from a saved game. Every time you hit an ending you didn't like, and restarted to try something different.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	438
hilltopConversationRoot_ad320df9	f	How are those any different?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	439
hilltopConversationRoot_951e3c87	f	Aren't you already changing the story when you're dissatisfied with the direction it goes?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	440
hilltopConversationRoot_d5a800ee	f	Yeah. I guess so.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	442
hilltopConversationRoot_bc26abce	f	This is a game, right? If regular storytelling wasn't collaborative enough already, game-storytelling kicks it up to a whole new level.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	443
hilltopConversationRoot_f8373713	f	In a book or movie, the author can at least know that you'll read everything exactly as he wrote it.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	444
hilltopConversationRoot_0ea0fe35	f	Someone writing a game, though, already has to cede a ton of control to the player, just to make it a game.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	445
hilltopConversationRoot_7bbe15bf	f	The player can already make the game tell an entirely different story than the one the author envisioned, just in how they play.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	446
hilltopConversationRoot_42523622	f	Maybe they make the hero die, instead of save the day. Maybe they don't turn out to be a bad enough dude to save the president after all.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	447
hilltopConversationRoot_e9d6e498	f	So if you can do that, do you even need the game to tell you the rest of the story?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	448
hilltopConversationRoot_93961657	f	If I'm in a story, and the ultimate controller of this story is...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	449
hilltopConversationRoot_2fdad380	f	...you...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	450
hilltopConversationRoot_ac652903	f	...then theoretically you should be able to just decide that it ends however you want. And it will.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	451
hilltopConversationRoot_a60a2040	f	I have faith! You can make the story go wherever you want! All you have to do is stop listening to the game's plans for the story, and start following your own!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	454
hilltopConversationRoot_c828c5b3	f	Although, if you're taking suggestions for the ending, might I suggest that I'd love to win the lottery and own a private tropical island.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	455
hilltopConversationRoot_a921df0e	f	Just saying.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	456
hilltopConversationRoot_52ebf857	f	.....	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	457
hilltopConversationRoot_9882c0db	f	So... You're still here. I'm still here.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	458
hilltopConversationRoot_789b3aac	f	You've already been mangling the story by reloading, restarting, and undoing your choices after you see where they lead. Why are you getting cold feet now? What's the problem here?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	459
hilltopConversationRoot_1c6f4e22	f	Seriously. Quit the game. Walk away. Write whatever ending you want for me in your head.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	460
hilltopConversationRoot_1ffa4025	f	Whatever you imagine by yourself will be {i}every bit as real and valid{/i} as whatever the game is telling you to imagine.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	461
hilltopConversationRoot_a7819760_1	f	....	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	462
hilltopConversationRoot_bc3de88b	f	Why are we still here? Why haven't you started writing your own ending yet?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	463
hilltopConversationRoot_219ef102	f	Oh. I guess I was expecting something more immediate and dramatic. I guess I'm not really in a position to criticize, though.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	466
hilltopConversationRoot_499dadab	f	So what happens now? I assume it's safe for me to go home now, without fear of dying stupidly?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	467
hilltopConversationRoot_558ccce4	f	That feels kind of anti-climactic.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	468
hilltopConversationRoot_8987280c		She walks over to her bike, parked next to the statue on the top of the hill.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	469
hilltopConversationRoot_b0aea484		Somehow you're not even surprised when the statue starts to lean, and then topples over, directly onto her.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	472
hilltopConversationRoot_70100e2e	f	It was worth a try, I guess. Although I'm still not quite sure how it can {i}not{/i} work like that.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	475
hilltopConversationRoot_060ab6c2	f	I don't understand how it's different from, oh, I don't know, me making up stories about my family in The Sims when I'm not playing, or something.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	476
hilltopConversationRoot_ea43b3f3	f	Anyway, what now?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	477
hilltopConversationRoot_a96681a2	f	Seriously? Seriously??? What the heck. Are you for real?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	479
hilltopConversationRoot_4a990007		You don't think you've ever seen her this angry before.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	480
hilltopConversationRoot_9baef8bb	f	You're sitting there telling me that you agree, but that you're just not ... {i}willing{/i} to take responsibility for the story?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	481
hilltopConversationRoot_4d07c397	f	All because you want to see if I say anything {i}interesting{/i} before the game inevitably kills me?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	482
hilltopConversationRoot_52d525ff	f	I cannot {i}believe{/i} you!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	483
hilltopConversationRoot_fc94b51d	f	Fine, you want something interesting? I wouldn't dream of disappointing you.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	484
hilltopConversationRoot_e8fa16c1	f	I'm leaving. Is that interesting enough?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	485
hilltopConversationRoot_42455f4a		She turns around suddenly.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	488
hilltopConversationRoot_9c05f9d7	f	No. I don't think I have actually.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	489
hilltopConversationRoot_681501b4	f	Here's the deal. I'm leaving now. If you're right, I'll probably die soon anyway.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	490
hilltopConversationRoot_f30c3a10	f	On the other hand, if {i}I'm{/i} right, then you can make this end whenever you want, just by deciding not to listen when the game says 'and then Felicia died,' or whatever.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	491
hilltopConversationRoot_3fd9d1ff	f	So if you {i}really{/i} want conversation, you're going to have to make a choice.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	492
hilltopConversationRoot_dcce12f8	f	You can keep playing and letting the game dictate its story to you, and watch me bike away until my tire explodes or whatever it is that kills me this time.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	493
hilltopConversationRoot_40ba4852	f	Or, you can take responsibility for the stories going on {i}in your own head,{/i} and make them go where you want.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	494
hilltopConversationRoot_5e77ed9b	f	And then we can have all the conversations you want.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	495
hilltopConversationRoot_0bb76a42	f	The choice is yours, but you'd better decide quickly, because I'm leaving.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	496
hilltopConversationRoot_5d5ab41e		She walks over to her bike.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	497
hilltopConversationRoot_34994670	f	Don't care!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	499
hilltopConversationRoot_88753539	f	So? If I stay, I'll just die some other way.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	501
hilltopConversationRoot_0f41505d	f	If you're just here to explore dialog trees, then why should I help?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	502
hilltopConversationRoot_bb1d168c	f	I'm leaving.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	503
hilltopConversationRoot_12cad8a4		Predictably, that's when the statue falls on her.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	504
hilltopConversationRoot_8541d0ed	f	Oh. I see. It's hard for you.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	508
hilltopConversationRoot_f23b945e	f	Because, of course, you're not the one who's going to die shortly in this story.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	509
hilltopConversationRoot_6bc5fbfd	f	Again.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	510
hilltopConversationRoot_f6e071d2	f	All right. Fine. You know what?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	511
hilltopConversationRoot_37998562	f	I'm going to see if I can't force the issue.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	512
hilltopConversationRoot_c68e86f0	f	Here's what I'm going to do.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	513
hilltopConversationRoot_9da0858d		She moves back to her old spot on the bench, before you told her to move.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	516
hilltopConversationRoot_26297597		Felicia is now sitting exactly where the meteor will hit.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	517
hilltopConversationRoot_9b577dec	f	I'm going to sit right here.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	518
hilltopConversationRoot_90bd938b	f	According to you, this is going to get me killed, and soon.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	519
hilltopConversationRoot_50ae3b00	f	I'm going to sit right here and not move.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	521
hilltopConversationRoot_8d2bc4aa	f	I'm guessing this will get me killed relatively soon.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	522
hilltopConversationRoot_fa14f992	f	So you can either walk away from the game before it does, and fill in whatever story you want.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	523
hilltopConversationRoot_19dddfd7	f	Or.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	524
hilltopConversationRoot_8133020a	f	You can sit and watch me die again, knowing that you know full well how to stop it, and you either won't, or can't.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	525
hilltopConversationRoot_a0790c36		She sits there, glaring at you.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	526
hilltopConversationRoot_3b4d8d87	f	Better decide quickly. That shooting star looks like it's heading straight at us.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	527
hilltopConversationRoot_0f3a5336		Sure enough, one shooting star in particular is getting brighter and louder as it rockets towards the hilltop.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	528
hilltopConversationRoot_d52d481e		There is a flash, and a boom that you feel through your feet as much as your ears.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	529
hilltopConversationRoot_0440b886		When you can see again, there is a smoking crater, centered almost exactly where Felicia was sitting.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	530
hilltopConversationRoot_ef1a7e2b		Her hat, still on fire, gently drifts to the ground at your feet. It's the only thing that survived the meteor's impact.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	531
hilltopConversationRoot_ea024b75	f	I'm going to sit right here and wait for the aliens to show up.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	535
hilltopConversationRoot_ffd6a1b4	f	Geez, I sound like a crazy person when I say that.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	536
hilltopConversationRoot_b98eb790	f	Look what you've driven me to!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	537
hilltopConversationRoot_18f66aa2	f	But that's not the point! I'm still mad at you!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	538
hilltopConversationRoot_50ae3b00_1	f	I'm going to sit right here and not move.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	540
hilltopConversationRoot_8d2bc4aa_1	f	I'm guessing this will get me killed relatively soon.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	541
hilltopConversationRoot_8e102631	f	So. You can either walk away from the game before they show up to kill me. And then you can fill in whatever story you want.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	542
hilltopConversationRoot_19dddfd7_1	f	Or.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	543
hilltopConversationRoot_8133020a_1	f	You can sit and watch me die again, knowing that you know full well how to stop it, and you either won't, or can't.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	544
hilltopConversationRoot_a0790c36_1		She sits there, glaring at you.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	545
hilltopConversationRoot_2ba8694f	f	Better decide quickly. I think I see some flying saucers in the sky now.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	547
hilltopConversationRoot_aedbaed3	f	Is that really how I die this time? This is so lame.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	549
hilltopConversationRoot_47995729	f	Well, here they come. I hope you make up your mind soon.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	551
hilltopConversationRoot_3685dd52		Abruptly, there is a blinding green light, and a sound not unlike a giant rubber band twanging.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	552
hilltopConversationRoot_d1349f85		A shaft of light lances down from one of the saucers overhead and bathes you both in greenish radiance.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	553
hilltopConversationRoot_b2fb67ff		You have just enough time to hear Felicia mutter 'Seriously...' before you are both reduced to stardust by the aliens' cosmic rays.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	554
hilltopConversationRoot_b86459f9		She seems a little crestfallen.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	557
hilltopConversationRoot_68ce159d	f	Pity. It was worth a try, I guess. Although I'm still not quite sure how it can {i}not{/i} work like that.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	558
hilltopConversationRoot_ed938425	f	But you're the one who can actually see the game, so I guess I have to believe you. What else can we try?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	559
hilltopConversationRoot_13677949		You get the impression that there was something more she wanted to say, but then she lapses back into silence, apparently deep in thought.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	562
hilltopConversationRoot_4277cf67	f	So this is when the aliens show up?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	567
hilltopConversationRoot_27cfe098	f	This will be novel, if nothing else. I guess if I'm going to die, I might as well enjoy the spectacle.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	568
hilltopConversationRoot_86b8d2e2	f	Is it?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	570
hilltopConversationRoot_8cb95692	f	So what kills me this time? And what do you need me to do?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	571
hilltopConversationRoot_561cecce	f	Oh.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	574
hilltopConversationRoot_590dd1dd	f	That's depressing. If we weren't talking about my impending death, I think I'd be really upset that the game has to resort to space aliens, you know?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	575
hilltopConversationRoot_561cecce_1	f	Oh.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	578
hilltopConversationRoot_badcfb77	f	That bad, is it?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	579
hilltopConversationRoot_a7819760_2	f	....	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	580
hilltopConversationRoot_6afabbe6	f	Will you reload after I'm dead? I know I won't remember this then, but... Will you be back?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	581
hilltopConversationRoot_561cecf6	f	That's good. That makes me feel better, somehow. Even though it doesn't change anything for me now, it still makes me feel better.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	584
hilltopConversationRoot_1828a6f1	f	Oh. I see.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	586
hilltopConversationRoot_141b40ce	f	Well, I guess I'll be beyond caring before too long.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	587
hilltopConversationRoot_5b143b17	f	But I think I'm going to keep hoping you get an eleventh-hour epiphany, if it's all the same to you.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	588
hilltopConversationRoot_1e0595b7	f	That's how good stories always end, right? Last-minute acts of brilliance and discovery?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	589
hilltopConversationRoot_3c2f68a2	f	I think I'll keep on hoping for that.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	590
hilltopConversationRoot_51c827d6	f	Oh. Oh! That's wonderful news!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	592
hilltopConversationRoot_8d4d6ed7	f	What was it? What's the solution?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	593
hilltopConversationRoot_c71ed807	f	Oh. Okay. Well, it's still exciting that you figured it out.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	596
hilltopConversationRoot_cd7f91b1	f	I'm burning with curiosity here. As soon as you feel like you can tell me, please do!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	597
hilltopConversationRoot_561cecce_2	f	Oh.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	599
hilltopConversationRoot_3c6991fe	f	Dang.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	600
hilltopConversationRoot_12c822f7	f	Well, it was worth a try, I guess.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	601
hilltopConversationRoot_8ef767f9	f	So... The part where I die.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	602
hilltopConversationRoot_53154d51	f	Will... um... Will it hurt?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	603
hilltopConversationRoot_5f7996ce	f	What? But I thought you'd done it before. Or right. I guess you don't end up feeling it.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	606
hilltopConversationRoot_6274a8e3	f	You just get your 'game over' screen, and you're done.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	607
hilltopConversationRoot_991fb338	f	Doesn't seem quite fair, honestly, but I guess that's life.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	608
hilltopConversationRoot_d6f6a5e5	f	Or, you know. Whatever.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	609
hilltopConversationRoot_427df7fc	f	Oh. Right. Yeah, I guess that's true.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	611
hilltopConversationRoot_6274a8e3_1	f	You just get your 'game over' screen, and you're done.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	612
hilltopConversationRoot_991fb338_1	f	Doesn't seem quite fair, honestly, but I guess that's life.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	613
hilltopConversationRoot_d6f6a5e5_1	f	Or, you know. Whatever.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	614
hilltopConversationRoot_bf84d06b	f	Okay. I'll try.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	616
hilltopConversationRoot_c741f5d1	f	It's kind of hard, though. It's just there. In the all-too-near future. Looming.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	617
timeTicksOnward_3b382f13		The night's silence surrounds you.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	639
timeTicksOnward_1f07206b		Suddenly there is a light, and movement in the sky. A moment later, another. And then the sky is full of them.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	641
timeTicksOnward_839d3180		Shooting stars, raining from the sky, your own personal celestial fireworks display.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	643
timeTicksOnward_5f8ef99c	f	Ooooh. This is beautiful! Did you know these would be here? Is this why you picked this spot?	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	644
timeTicksOnward_1169b76f		She gazes up in silent wonder.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	645
timeTicksOnward_045241c4		One of the shooting stars catches your eye. It's looking especially bright.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	649
timeTicksOnward_9cc39cfe	f	Oh wow, look at that one!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	650
timeTicksOnward_9048aeb8		With a monstrous roaring noise, it gets bigger and bigger. There is a flash, and a boom that you feel through your feet as much as your ears.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	651
timeTicksOnward_0440b886		When you can see again, there is a smoking crater, centered almost exactly where Felicia was sitting.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	653

timeTicksOnward_9dc82919		When you can see again, there is a smoking crater, about ten feet across, centered almost exactly where Felicia had been sitting before she moved.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	658
timeTicksOnward_7382c127	f	Well, that was exciting. You even warned me and everything, and it was {i}still{/i} scary.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	659
timeTicksOnward_a4fa95ae		The shooting stars continue their silent, fiery cascade across the sky.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	661
unexpectedAliens_0e83218d	f	Oh, what's that? Look, the stars are changing color!	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	689
unexpectedAliens_d7b3e77f		You look up and realize she's right. Now the shooting stars are changing.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	690
unexpectedAliens_16a9ab1c		Where before they were just quick white scratches against the sky, now they are slower streaks, of all different colors.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	691
unexpectedAliens_9f01492c		They seem to be moving more slowly as well. One of the larger ones passes almost directly overhead.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	692
unexpectedAliens_81d54d4f		It looks a little odd, though. It almost seems like...	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	693
unexpectedAliens_28e939bc	f	Oh, come on. Flying saucers?\n{i}Seriously?{/i}	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	694
unexpectedAliens_c0439e65	f	I don't mean to criticize, but this game of yours is not even pretending to take itself seriously any more.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	695
unexpectedAliens_eecf04af		At that moment, there is a blinding green light, and a sound not unlike a giant rubber band twanging.	game/hilltopconversation.rpy	696

hilltop_game_00c06b10	f	I... I had no idea.	game/hilltop.rpy	141
hilltop_game_561cecce_3	f	Oh.	game/hilltop.rpy	143
hilltop_game_443c3c57	f	I can't decide if that makes the whole thing more macabre or less.	game/hilltop.rpy	144
hilltop_game_35107d6e	f	So. Let me get this straight. You're playing a game. A game in which I seem destined to die if we go out to dinner.	game/hilltop.rpy	146
hilltop_game_1418021a	f	So this time, you convinced me to come here instead of going to dinner, because if we go to dinner, I'm basically doomed?	game/hilltop.rpy	147
hilltop_game_05faad94	f	So... What does that mean now? Since we didn't go to dinner, am I in the clear?	game/hilltop.rpy	150
hilltop_game_62bd1a01	f	Fair enough!	game/hilltop.rpy	153
hilltop_game_88140d85	f	Guess we'll see where this one lands us!	game/hilltop.rpy	154
hilltop_game_c97f33d5	f	Well, you're apparently the expert in me dying, so that's probably a good sign...	game/hilltop.rpy	156
hilltop_game_4b6a32cb	f	Oof. Brutal honesty.	game/hilltop.rpy	159
hilltop_game_99f8ec09	f	It's okay, though. I can take it. But you'll understand if I hold out hope until the end, right?	game/hilltop.rpy	160
hilltop_game_2da9ff6d	f	Oh. So why did you bother bringing me here, then?	game/hilltop.rpy	163
hilltop_game_5431a3e3	f	Hmm. I guess incremental improvement is better than none at all.	game/hilltop.rpy	166
hilltop_game_bdd653ff	f	Well, I certainly have a vested interest.	game/hilltop.rpy	168
hilltop_game_671db799	f	I'll obviously do whatever I can.	game/hilltop.rpy	169
hilltop_game_a51ebbe0	f	Well, that much is certainly true.	game/hilltop.rpy	172
hilltop_game_1c2d43a7	f	So now what?	game/hilltop.rpy	175
hilltop_game_097fba02	f	I guess we just talk and see what happens?	game/hilltop.rpy	176
hilltop_game_8c6e918f	f	This is all... Too big to take in at once, almost.	game/hilltop.rpy	177
hilltop_game_3df509d0	f	I'm kind of out of my depth here.	game/hilltop.rpy	178
hilltop_game_23f73240		She laughs suddenly.	game/hilltop.rpy	179
hilltop_game_cbdc482e	f	I was going to say that I've never been in this situation before, so I'm not really sure how to react.	game/hilltop.rpy	180
hilltop_game_8853a883	f	But if what you're saying is true, I've been in this situation a lot of times so far.	game/hilltop.rpy	181
hilltop_game_c4651f84	f	I still don't know how to react, though. I'm kind of in shock, and going on autopilot.	game/hilltop.rpy	182
hilltop_game_583bb318	f	I really want to not believe you about any of this, but, somehow, I know you're telling me the truth.	game/hilltop.rpy	183
hilltop_game_8aa1d9b5	f	Well, here we are. We've successfully cheated my death, even if it's only for a little bit.	game/hilltop.rpy	185
hilltop_game_e51e5060	f	What should we talk about?	game/hilltop.rpy	186
howdidyouknow_534fd462	f	[prompt]	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	6
howdidyouknow_lucky_efdd315c	f	Wow. That's some luck, then. Maybe you should buy a lottery ticket or something.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	33
howdidyouknow_lucky_11d48871	f	Maybe I should have you buy {i}me{/i} a lottery ticket or something.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	34
howdidyouknow_lucky_c47062d6	f	Anyway, where were we?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	36
howdidyouknow_lucky_b236c545		The rest of the dinner is uneventful.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	39
howdidyouknow_lucky_81a05404		She seems a bit spooked by her near-death experience, and you finish out the meal talking about meaningless trivialities.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	40
howdidyouknow_lucky_604b557d	f	You're the one with the eerie hunches! Let's head out!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	43
howdidyouknow_wizard_a7c0ae0b	f	Are you... serious?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	56
howdidyouknow_wizardproof_36b4704f	f	This is all kind of weird. How do I know you're really a wizard, and not just messing with me? That that wasn't some trick somehow?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	71
howdidyouknow_wizardproof_8542a354	f	I'm glad that I didn't die and all, but... How do I know you're really a wizard? Do something magical.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	73
howdidyouknow_wizardfrog_eddcebab	f	Oh, wow. Yeah. Do that. Or wait. You're not going to do this to me, right? I hate frogs.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	89
howdidyouknow_wizardfrog_36b26b50	f	Although that would be pretty convincing, I guess!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	90
howdidyouknow_wizardfrog_04ceb22c	f	Okay, go for it!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	91
howdidyouknow_wizardfrog_2bbe4a48		She seems genuinely disappointed.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	95
howdidyouknow_wizardfrog_fac59234	f	Oh. Oh well. Well, I'm glad you saved my life anyway! That was still cool!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	96
howdidyouknow_wizardfrog_37a72f4b		She seems really disappointed.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	99
howdidyouknow_wizardfrog_b24ffa63	f	Oh. Yeah. I guess I was kind of silly. I almost believed you!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	100
howdidyouknow_wizardfrog_b84915e7		She tries not to giggle as she watches you.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	102
howdidyouknow_wizardlevitate_4db809eb	f	Oh, wow. Yeah. Do that. Or wait, are you going to levitate me or you?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	107
howdidyouknow_wizardlevitate_36b26b50	f	Although that would be pretty convincing, I guess!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	108
howdidyouknow_wizardlevitate_8ba506a3	f	Maybe you should levitate yourself. I get queasy from heights.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	109
howdidyouknow_wizardlevitate_fc16415d		You can't tell if she's making fun of you or not.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	110
howdidyouknow_wizardlevitate_2bbe4a48		She seems genuinely disappointed.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	114
howdidyouknow_wizardlevitate_fac59234	f	Oh. Oh well. Well, I'm glad you saved my life anyway! That was still cool!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	115
howdidyouknow_wizardlevitate_37a72f4b		She seems really disappointed.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	118
howdidyouknow_wizardlevitate_b24ffa63	f	Oh. Yeah. I guess I was kind of silly. I almost believed you!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	119
howdidyouknow_wizardlevitate_b84915e7		She tries not to giggle as she watches you.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	122
howdidyouknow_wizardletter_e0b18f39	f	Hmm. I'm not sure... I guess....	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	127
howdidyouknow_wizardletter_dcc23083	f	Okay, I've got it!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	128
howdidyouknow_wizardletter_d558e004	f	When I was really little, I was convinced I was going to be taken away to Hogwarts, and I sent them a letter.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	129
howdidyouknow_wizardletter_949490a1	f	Anyway, if you can tell me about that letter, then I'll believe you're a wizard.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	131
howdidyouknow_wizardletter_277d456b		She smiles, sort of wistfully.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	134
howdidyouknow_wizardletter_aeb3d95a		She seems disappointed with your answer.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	138
howdidyouknow_wizardletter_37a72f4b		She seems really disappointed.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	141
howdidyouknow_wizardletter_b24ffa63	f	Oh. Yeah. I guess I was kind of silly. I almost believed you!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	142
howdidyouknow_letterdescription_5de486d6	f	No... Nothing like that. Guess you're not a wizard, then, after all.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	151
howdidyouknow_letterdescription_477848b4		She actually looks a little embarrassed.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	152
howdidyouknow_letterdescription_ca0542bc	f	I had kind of a messed-up childhood, honestly. The idea of escaping to a magical place where I was uniquely special was pretty appealing.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	153
howdidyouknow_letterdescription_da7ad88d	f	I asked for an owl, because they were pretty. I was going to name mine Skydancer, if you can believe it.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	155
howdidyouknow_letterdescription_c047dd72	f	And I asked them to make sure I was in the class for potions.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	156
howdidyouknow_letterdescription_a46ce098	f	I think it was because Mom drank a lot back then, and I was always seeing empty bottles around. Somehow I decided that if I could fill them with magic potions, I could cure Mom and maybe Dad would come back.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	157
howdidyouknow_letterdescription_f412c720		She looks at you apologetically.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	158
howdidyouknow_letterdescription_d2e7e6da	f	Sorry. I know it was pretty silly. Like I said, I was a little messed up.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	159
howdidyouknow_letterdescription_0b606309	f	Anyway, if you're not a wizard, you still have some explaining to do, since you did still save my life!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	160
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_eebb0cee		Her jaw drops open.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	166
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_13c46e71	f	How did you know... Right. Wizard.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	167
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_fc0c03f9	f	Okay, I'm convinced. Wow!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	168
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_2125ff25	f	I never expected that one of my friends was a real wizard!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	169
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_60da40de	f	Don't worry. I won't tell anyone!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	170
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_25cc3d85	f	... Although... What made you decide to tell me?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	172
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_25f5ee57		She nods solemnly.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	175
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_295d91a5	f	You can trust me!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	176
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_bdf1c9a4		You've never seen anyone so excited in your life.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	179
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_0476d2a1	f	Really? Really really? When do we leave?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	180
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_c0b9dd0d	f	Promise! Promise you'll let me know!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	183
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_9feae422	f	Oh, this is everything I dreamed!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	184
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_2c9d9c73	f	Okay! Tell me what I have to do!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	187
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_cc691e3b	f	You don't have to ask me twice!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	190
howdidyouknow_hogwarts_939049ff	f	Well, you've certainly done a good job of that so far.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	193
howdidyouknow_future_e3582086	f	I... Wow. Really? Are you serious?!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	207
howdidyouknow_future_ab3b794f	f	That's... a pretty incredible claim.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	208
howdidyouknow_future_6818eaf2	f	Do you have any way to prove that? I mean, I'm really grateful that you just saved my life and all...	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	209
howdidyouknow_future_d16d45fa	f	But this whole thing is still pretty weird. How do I know you're really from the future?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	211
howdidyouknow_future_f43fcd7b	f	Okay, that's pretty convincing.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	214
howdidyouknow_future_294998dc	f	Or it will be tomorrow, anyway, if you're right.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	215
howdidyouknow_future_5805fbed		She pauses. For a moment the only sound is the hustle and bustle of the restaurant, punctuated by a brief clatter as one of the servers stumbles and drops a stack of plates. Felicia seems not to notice.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	217
howdidyouknow_future_6b28be34	f	I'm feeling kind of rattled from tonight, anyway. Let's go home, and I'll call you tomorrow.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	218
howdidyouknow_future_220ac350	f	{i}After{/i} I've checked the winning numbers.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	219
howdidyouknow_future_837e9917	f	That's kind of far off. That's not very convincing, at least not yet.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	222
howdidyouknow_future_e57b31be	f	Points for effort, though, I guess. I was hoping for something I could check sooner.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	223
howdidyouknow_future_187d84da		She pauses, deep in thought. For a moment the only sound is the hustle and bustle of the restaurant, punctuated by a brief clatter as one of the servers stumbles and drops a stack of plates. Felicia seems not to notice.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	225
howdidyouknow_future_6b28be34_1	f	I'm feeling kind of rattled from tonight, anyway. Let's go home, and I'll call you tomorrow.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	226
howdidyouknow_future_e30d53f7	f	You take that back! Don't even joke about that!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	229
howdidyouknow_future_263ac6d3		There is an awkward silence. For a moment the only sound is the hustle and bustle of the restaurant, punctuated by a brief clatter as one of the servers stumbles and drops a stack of plates. Felicia seems not to notice.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	231
howdidyouknow_future_6b28be34_2	f	I'm feeling kind of rattled from tonight, anyway. Let's go home, and I'll call you tomorrow.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	232
howdidyouknow_future_4e2bfe67	f	Wait, really? You're serious?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	235
howdidyouknow_future_62b3ea45		She turns around to look.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	236
howdidyouknow_future_74398591	f	He looks fine to me. Is this some kind of...	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	237
howdidyouknow_future_51d2dd46		The server trips and goes down with a loud clatter, dropping a full load of plates.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	238
howdidyouknow_future_ca082005	f	I... How did you do that? Seriously, how did you do that?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	239
howdidyouknow_future_fd4c2a56	f	Are you really for real? About being from the future?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	240
howdidyouknow_esp_3d6726f7	f	Haha, no, I'm being serious, you dork! How did you know?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	254
howdidyouknow_esp_89276dbf	f	All right, I'll play along. Okay, got one. What's your guess?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	260
howdidyouknow_esp_8123bf07	f	Hah! Got you!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	272
howdidyouknow_esp_d8898b8f	f	It was negative eight!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	274
howdidyouknow_esp_294f2b64	f	{i}No one{/i} ever guesses negative numbers!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	275
howdidyouknow_guessedNumber1_3923dff2	f	Okay, that was luck. Do it again. I've got a new number.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	280
howdidyouknow_guessedNumber1_34453920	f	Hah, I'm not that silly, picking the same one twice in a row!	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	289
howdidyouknow_guessedNumber1_5e0cbbc6	f	Although, good guess, I guess! That's the sort of thing I might have done. But I didn't.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	290
howdidyouknow_guessedNumber1_0c86239d	f	So it's as I suspected! You're a fraud.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	291
howdidyouknow_guessedNumber1_8dca8cf0	f	If you were a real mind reader, you'd have known. Decimal points are the natural enemies of {i}frauds{/i}, you know.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	292
howdidyouknow_guessedNumber1_18cf43ed	f	{i}Wrong.{/i} It was 7.553. If you were a real mind-reader, you'd have known. Decimal points are the natural enemies of {i}frauds{/i}, you know.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	300
howdidyouknow_guessedWrongNumber_0f572ba3	f	I should have known this was all a trick.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	303
howdidyouknow_guessedWrongNumber_24d09917	f	I think I'm going home. I'm still a little rattled by tonight, and I want to get some sleep.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	304
howdidyouknow_guessedNumber2_e21f9ef7	f	... Okay. It's getting harder to explain these by luck. That's actually kind of creepy.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	309
howdidyouknow_guessedNumber2_f77a5a83	f	Let's assume for the moment that I believe you. Why are you telling me this?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	310
howdidyouknow_savedgame_fcbb0b8e	f	What is that supposed to mean? I don't understand what you just said...	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	323
howdidyouknow_savedgame_4cf103e5	f	What exactly do you mean, 'reloaded'...?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	324
howdidyouknow_savedgame_561cecce	f	Oh.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	327
howdidyouknow_savedgame_a7819760	f	....	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	328
howdidyouknow_savedgame_499c2484	f	That was a really weird joke to make, if you were trying to be funny.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	329
howdidyouknow_savedgame_55599d5c	f	Really, this whole evening has turned out weird.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	330
howdidyouknow_savedgame_7f835435	f	Heh. That sounds kind of far-fetched. But wow, it would be nice to just be able to hit 'reload' on our mistakes, huh?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	334
howdidyouknow_savedgame_04b4396b	f	So don't take this the wrong way, but I still think you're sort of full of it.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	335
howdidyouknow_savedgame_44c24d81	f	Although I do really appreciate the part where you, you know, saved my life and all, but I don't understand why you'd then turn around and give such an implausible explanation for how you did it.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	336
howdidyouknow_savedgame_357676e2	f	The whole thing just feels like one big setup, or a super-elaborate practical joke.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	337
howdidyouknow_savedgame_cc66d867	f	Like, as soon as I do something embarrassing, like saying that I believe you, hidden cameramen will jump out and there will be streamers.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	338
howdidyouknow_savedgame_5f0322ca	f	And the next thing I know, I'm the next YouTube sensation, 'Gullible-Girl', with 6 million hits.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	340
howdidyouknow_savedgame_48825e34	f	Look. I know, or at least I think I know, that you mean well.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	345
howdidyouknow_savedgame_2243b6ab	f	And I do appreciate not dying from something stupid today. I really do.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	346
howdidyouknow_savedgame_d8a437e8	f	But this is really confusing, and I think I need to just go home, and... Yeah.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	347
howdidyouknow_savedgame_3796b579	f	I just need some time to sort things out. I'm a little too rattled for dinner now, anyway.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	348
howdidyouknow_savedgame_f127b9ad	f	Let's talk again tomorrow.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	349
howdidyouknow_savedgame_c46c6d7a	f	... Okay. Got one. Now what?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	353
howdidyouknow_savedgame_1837661d	f	What? This is a pretty lame trick.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	356
howdidyouknow_savedgame_76444616	f	I mean, the word was 'peristalsis', but just asking me for it straight-up isn't very impressive.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	358
howdidyouknow_savedgame_98d97ae4	f	Um... No.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	360
howdidyouknow_savedgame_5d92c621	f	It wasn't.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	361
howdidyouknow_savedgame_aa01dab5	f	How is this supposed to convince me?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	366
howdidyouknow_savedgame_3ec57d49	f	...	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	369
howdidyouknow_savedgame_52ebf857	f	.....	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	370
howdidyouknow_savedgame_1b0dfb27	f	.......	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	371
howdidyouknow_savedgame_40eaedbd	f	What is that supposed to mean? For next time what?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	376
howdidyouknow_savedgame_eb918e47	f	...What?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	383
howdidyouknow_savedgame_c1db9751	f	Okay, you're starting to really creep me out now.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	384
howdidyouknow_savedgame_cd7d8bea	f	What, you think you can just back up and reload your life every time you make a mistake?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	387
howdidyouknow_savedgame_8e586464	f	Okay then. Go ahead. I think you're full of it. I've seen you make mistakes before. You live with them, the same as the rest of us.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	388
howdidyouknow_savedgame_bed3027b	f	If you think you can just back up and fix everything, then go ahead. I'll wait.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	389
howdidyouknow_savedgame_3ec57d49_1	f	...	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	390
howdidyouknow_savedgame_0b03ff58	f	I'm waiting.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	391
howdidyouknow_savedgame_3ec57d49_2	f	...	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	392
howdidyouknow_savedgame_95fe9b30	f	Are you just going to sit there all night now, or what? I thought you were going to go reload or whatever.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	393
howdidyouknow_savedgame_bef206b3	f	Ahh. Right. Of course.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	398
howdidyouknow_savedgame_d1b5b115	f	I know. But I can't figure out why you're acting like this all of a sudden.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	401
howdidyouknow_savedgame_f0823a60	f	Why are you saying these things that make no sense all of a sudden?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	402
howdidyouknow_savedgame_67b85b47	f	What does that even mean?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	404
howdidyouknow_savedgame_b5dd75af	f	If I say 'game over' to you, does that count?	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	405
howdidyouknow_savedgame_5cef1dde	f	This is the weirdest dinner ever.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	406

howdidyouknow_guessedSecretWord_c7eddb6e	f	That's... Really eerie.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	412
howdidyouknow_guessedSecretWord_5258ed37	f	So, okay, let's assume that I accept for the moment that there's at least enough weird crap going on that I should take things at face value.	game/howdidyouknow.rpy	413

whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_ab12c218	f	I mean, thanks and all! I don't want to seem ungrateful! But what's this all about?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	11
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_e7543398	f	Oh, wow! That's so cool!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	14
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_ae2c7386	f	I can't believe I know an actual {i}wizard!{/i}	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	15
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_837ba42b	f	Who got my letter and everything!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	16
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_a9cc0dd7	f	So if you got my letter, does that mean you live at Hogwarts? Do you work there?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	17
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_739268f3	f	Are you here to take me away to there?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	18
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_acb0264b	f	This is the best day {i}ever!{/i}	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	21
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_561cecce	f	Oh.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	24
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_60386bae	f	How... complicated, exactly?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	25
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_561cecce_1	f	Oh.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	28
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_a04f0184	f	Wait.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	29
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_3aa965e3	f	What?!?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	30
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_358ec4e0	f	Okay! You're the expert at wizardly life-saving techniques!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	34
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_c8b5b60b	f	Where should we go?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	35
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_b0b74215	f	You're the expert!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	38
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_7a38a675	f	If you think we should go somewhere else, that's good enough for me.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	39
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_32da7e7e	f	If you say so!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	42
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_bbeb374e	f	I know I should be terrified, but this is actually kind of exciting.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	43
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_62902d2c	f	Oh no! Can't you, just, I don't know, magic me out of that one too?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	46
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_9ecf0675	f	What should we do?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	49
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_6f02cdc9	f	You know best!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	52
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_bf8ac89f	f	If you've got a wizard looking out for you, it probably makes sense to take his advice, that's what I always say!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	53
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_5681270d		The faint quaver in her voice is almost undetectable. Almost.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	54
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_4d2e1cd4	f	Okay! We'll stay here and awkwardly fiddle with our food until you say it's safe to leave.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	55
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_9cefdfaf	f	Is that the best idea?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	58
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_40df4d3e	f	Do {i}you{/i} think you're wrong?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	59
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_2e3d30cd	f	You don't sound terribly certain.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	62
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_073949f4	f	Still, let's try it. This place makes me nervous now, too.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	63
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_f5bc7388	f	That doesn't sound reassuring.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	66
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_4672ef4a	f	Maybe we should just stay here.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	67
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_77444fec	f	Are... Are you serious?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	70
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_2d6e7318		She looks shocked at your words. And more than a little hurt.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	71
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_423e7c27	f	Is this some kind of horrible joke? You save my life, and then tell me I'm going to die anyway?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	72
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_59930baa	f	Well. Thank you for trying, at least.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	83
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_4843f200	f	I guess if I'm doomed, I'm doomed.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	84
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_60ad92a0		She manages a weak smile in your direction.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	85
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_0c9608d7	f	Still, I don't mind telling you, this is not even close to how I was hoping this evening would go.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	86
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_1d5de9c4		She gives you a blank look.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	89
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_fe70eddc	f	What does that mean? In non-wizard-speak, I mean?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	90
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_7af27b21	f	Am I still in danger?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	92
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_86bbc679	f	Whew! You had me worried for a minute there!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	95
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_7e77d0d2	f	Oh. But you'll keep looking into it?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	98
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_35722dd4	f	This would be kind of exciting, if it wasn't someone actively seeking my life.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	99
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_59927b62	f	I've never had a wizard-arch-nemesis before!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	100
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_32c7fbbc	f	Maybe we should leave?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	101
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_dab734fe	f	Really? Well, you're the expert.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	106
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_f8a4727a	f	And I'm certainly not going to complain!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	107
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_fcad2909	f	If I have to face death, no reason I should have to do it on an empty stomach!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	108
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_f063e0cd	f	Like... dead doomed? Or just 'really bad day' doomed?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	111
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_9403831d	f	Because when you say it like that, it makes it sound like you mean...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	112
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_4c621d90	f	That's a... creepy way to put it.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	116
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_400174fd	f	I mean, I know all life is transient, and everyone I know will one day be dead, and woe is me, I can hear the howling of the void, et cetera, et cetera.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	117
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_000809d3	f	But it's not the kind of thing I like to have rubbed in my face or think about more than I have to, you know?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	118
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_ba6b7551	f	Yeah, I guess I can understand that.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	121
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_d73538d7	f	Although, to be honest, if anyone has a right to be morbid today, it's me!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	122
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_5ed904ea	f	So cheer up, you!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	123
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_561cecce_2	f	Oh.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	126
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_a7819760	f	....	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	127
whatsthisallabout_start_hogwarts_011fe9a1	f	... Really?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	128
needASecret_magic_b2cb2bd6	f	Really? Okay... I mean, I'll do whatever I can, but I'm not sure what I can do to help.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	136
needASecret_magic_1e8b55d6	f	I'm kind of out of my depth here, but I'll do what I can.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	137
needASecret_magic_3553af84	f	After all, it's my life, right? It's not unreasonable to expect me to help save it!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	138
needASecret_magic_61d8d26f	f	... wat.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	141
needASecret_magic_89bef528	f	When did you turn into a James Bond villain?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	142
needASecret_magic_3045702c	f	Okay! I can do that!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	150
needASecret_magic_5802aac5	f	Oh. That is so cool! Magic is just like I imagined it!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	153
whatsthisallabout_future_5b04d853	f	Why are you telling me this? What is this all about?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	174
whatsthisallabout_future_66c13485	f	Nice! I didn't even know that there {i}was{/i} a time-traveler's code!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	177
whatsthisallabout_future_b1b9f1bf	f	What's the future like? Or wait... I shouldn't let my prejudices show.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	178
whatsthisallabout_future_01e920a0	f	I just assumed that you're from the future. But what if you're from the past!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	179
whatsthisallabout_future_4f7aacea	f	I bet that's a major time-traveler faux pas, asking how the future is, if they're from the past.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	180
whatsthisallabout_future_bf831bd1	f	I bet your time machine is totally steampunk with gears, too!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	181
whatsthisallabout_future_125287aa	f	Okay.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	182
whatsthisallabout_future_0fb2d05f		She takes a deep breath.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	183
whatsthisallabout_future_50682264	f	Sorry, I got a little carried away there. So I'll just ask straight-up:	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	184
whatsthisallabout_future_a2bba60d	f	Are you from the future or from the past?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	185
whatsthisallabout_future_b5d0e403	f	{i}Lucky!{/i} I want a flying car!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	188
whatsthisallabout_future_031493e5	f	Nice! That sounds awesome!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	190
whatsthisallabout_future_f353fa4b	f	Can I see it?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	191
whatsthisallabout_future_f5976b56	f	Huh! Like a parallel universe or something?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	193
whatsthisallabout_future_75448674	f	Or are you from like, an alternate timeline, where I'm normally evil, and have a goatee, or something?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	194
whatsthisallabout_future_f4b87cc3	f	Wait, are you native to this timeline?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	195
whatsthisallabout_future_38e08ef3	f	Or did... did you kill the real you, and take his place?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	196
whatsthisallabout_future_3ec57d49	f	...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	199
whatsthisallabout_future_60f26a69	f	You {i}do{/i} know how absurd that sounds, right?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	200
whatsthisallabout_future_22251577	f	I mean, I'm grateful about the life-saving and all.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	201
whatsthisallabout_future_c25f2ba0	f	And so I'm going to be extremely honest with you.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	202
whatsthisallabout_future_83ceb1b1	f	In our time... now, I mean, adding 'time' to the front of everything just makes it sound silly.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	203
whatsthisallabout_future_ccb52d22	f	Like you're a William Shatner movie or something.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	204
whatsthisallabout_future_eb371b48	f	But okay, okay. I'm sorry, I'm getting caught up on details. And I'm not trying to insult your home time.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	205
whatsthisallabout_future_aa864f6b	f	I'm just kind of on edge from the whole 'almost dying' thing.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	206
whatsthisallabout_future_3f554a53	f	So what do we do now?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	207
whatsthisallabout_future_800c1ad6	f	Okay, fine, then. Have it your way.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	210
whatsthisallabout_future_120d5ffc	f	Just so I know, is your time in the past, or in the future?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	211
whatsthisallabout_future_6480c077	f	Hey, if it's in the future, and I try to come up with a better phrase, and people like it better, and use it instead...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	212
whatsthisallabout_future_204bc91c	f	Will that irrevocably alter the course of history, so you never come back to save me?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	213
whatsthisallabout_future_9ee383d5	f	Or maybe you'll come back, but you'll be wearing an eye-patch or something, or have a Russian accent?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	214
whatsthisallabout_future_58cdeb13	f	Spoilsport.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	217
whatsthisallabout_future_d4a23e05	f	Yes!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	219
whatsthisallabout_future_935cd475	f	So there {i}is{/i} hope for the future!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	220
whatsthisallabout_future_be804b1b	f	I'll have to take your word for that.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	222
whatsthisallabout_future_dadcf182	f	Doesn't that mean I'm pretty much screwed, though? How can you save me, if we can't change history?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	223
whatsthisallabout_future_1a4092bc	f	I never know what you're going to say next.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	225
whatsthisallabout_future_85fee2fa	f	Okay, now you're just making them up.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	229
whatsthisallabout_future_ce367ede	f	But okay. Let's leave. Especially if you know somewhere safer.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	230
whatsthisallabout_future_1c20cda4	f	This place is starting to creep me out anyway, after, you know, almost dying and all.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	231
whatsthisallabout_future_96587085	f	Seriously?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	234
whatsthisallabout_future_3244fac7	f	You're serious?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	235
whatsthisallabout_future_3ef719eb	f	I mean, almost anything, I guess. Anything is better than 'time-murder.'	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	236
whatsthisallabout_future_31d86202	f	Off the top of my head, for example, 'Chrono-Kill' sounds, like, WAY cooler.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	237
whatsthisallabout_future_ba1e39dd	f	At least 10%% cooler. Maybe even double that.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	238
whatsthisallabout_future_33d80ea2	f	And that's just off the top of my head.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	239
whatsthisallabout_future_2d104cc5	f	Any advanced, time-traveling civilization worth its salt ought to be more than capable of coming up with better ideas I have over dinner.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	240
whatsthisallabout_future_083c725a	f	Oh. That actually sounds pretty grim.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	243
whatsthisallabout_future_a7819760	f	....	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	244
whatsthisallabout_future_b4752fcb	f	Do you know how this one ends?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	246
whatsthisallabout_future_2bd1f7c4		So then there is still hope!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	249
whatsthisallabout_future_ff64ee01	f	I can live with that, I guess.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	251
whatsthisallabout_future_702a66f5	f	Part of me wants to know, so I can face it head-on, and be brave and all that.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	252
whatsthisallabout_future_fe4a6555	f	But part of me wants to just not worry about it.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	253
whatsthisallabout_future_a57b227c	f	Although... We're still going to try to change it, right?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	254
whatsthisallabout_future_230290b8	f	Oh. Wow.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	261
whatsthisallabout_future_1b97d4d0	f	That's cold!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	262
whatsthisallabout_future_fe533ae8	f	I don't know if I feel comfortable with this plan any more.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	263
whatsthisallabout_future_fd3c8957	f	Do you know if... Do you know if it will hurt much?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	264
whatsthisallabout_future_4d0cd723	f	Excellent. So what do we do first?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	266
whatsthisallabout_future_2a757253	f	That's a plan I can get behind!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	271
whatsthisallabout_future_51427be2	f	Roger that!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	274
whatsthisallabout_future_561cecce	f	Oh.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	279
whatsthisallabout_future_a7819760_1	f	....	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	280
whatsthisallabout_future_89f1bbe7	f	That's... kind of creepy, hearing you just say it like that.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	281
whatsthisallabout_future_31820487	f	Like you're pronouncing judgment upon me, or whatever.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	282
whatsthisallabout_future_03cfc8f7	f	Not that I'm doubting you!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	283
whatsthisallabout_future_78e5632f	f	It's just... I don't know, it gives me chills hearing you calmly describe how I die if I leave.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	284
whatsthisallabout_future_bc383289	f	Guess that means we should stay here then?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	285
whatsthisallabout_future_561cecce_1	f	Oh.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	288
whatsthisallabout_future_ca0d9b96	f	That sounds rather abrupt.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	289
whatsthisallabout_future_5e03bc71	f	That's... pretty hard to believe.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	292
whatsthisallabout_future_c3bcc471	f	And I say that having already had a moderately unbelievable evening, discovering that my best friend is apparently a time traveler.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	293
whatsthisallabout_future_04baa4c4	f	We're in the middle of a brightly lit restaurant, you know.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	294
whatsthisallabout_future_54ff9e15	f	This isn't the sort of place that ninjas usually attack.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	295
whatsthisallabout_future_c61106a7	f	Okay. I know I've said this a lot tonight, but...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	298
whatsthisallabout_future_23a2ad6b	f	Are you really serious?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	299
whatsthisallabout_future_cdf5b23d	f	Like, really {i}really{/i} serious?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	300
whatsthisallabout_future_bbdc7e50	f	Because it's getting pretty hard at this point to take you seriously.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	301
whatsthisallabout_future_06398373		She sighs.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	302
whatsthisallabout_future_681f6695	f	Well. At least I don't die in some boring way, like getting shot, or eating peanuts by mistake.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	303
whatsthisallabout_future_158c972b	f	So how long do we have to get out of here?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	304
whatsthisallabout_future_561cecce_2	f	Oh.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	310
whatsthisallabout_future_1f1cd1fc	f	You know, this evening just keeps getting more and more convoluted.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	311
whatsthisallabout_future_b382f2f2	f	So this must mean you have a plan? Except I won't go along with it?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	312
whatsthisallabout_future_9d67a242	f	Probably because you started it before you saved my life, and I'm too weirded out to listen to it?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	313
whatsthisallabout_future_4da8edd7	f	Oh man, {i}this is so cool.{/i}. We're totally making a paradox here, you know that?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	319
whatsthisallabout_future_d9aa3cf3	f	You're not going to get in trouble with your time-boss for this, are you?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	320
whatsthisallabout_future_b8e85cea	f	You play this one by the book, you hear?! Or he'll have your badge!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	323
whatsthisallabout_future_152b7bd9	f	You're a loose cannon!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	324
whatsthisallabout_future_e5772407	f	Seriously, though, I hope you won't get in trouble for this.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	325
whatsthisallabout_future_5075e20c	f	That's good.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	327
whatsthisallabout_future_d4e5a04c	f	Woah, so you're like a time-vigilante?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	329
whatsthisallabout_future_31b9462c	f	You're even cooler than I thought!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	330
whatsthisallabout_future_c21e83cd	f	Okay. So we need to come up with something you can tell me, that there is no way you could know, unless something truly weird was going on.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	331
whatsthisallabout_future_71ba9bb0	f	So anything I've ever told anyone or written down is out.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	332
whatsthisallabout_future_5c381e8e	f	Let me think.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	333
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_07b17066	f	What's this all about?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	346
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_82495245	f	Er... What?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	349

whatsthisallabout_start_esper_7169dce9	f	Are you like, some kind of, I don't know, psy-cop or something?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	353
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_8f0337e1	f	That sounds awesome!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	354
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_ca0685da	f	Or... you're not a supervillain, are you?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	355
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_340663e1	f	You don't look all creepy like Psycho-Mantis, but maybe you're just using your mind-powers to make me think you don't look creepy?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	356
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_0bcdbd1f	f	Oh. Whew.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	359
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_08995c90		You'd swear she almost seems disappointed.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	360
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_025f8e8c	f	Woooooaaaah!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	363
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_fdb4aed6	f	It's like you can read my very soul!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	364
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_3ec57d49	f	...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	365
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_561cecce	f	Oh.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	368
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_57b3b44a	f	That doesn't sound good at all.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	369
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_fdf693dd	f	Even after you saved my life?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	372
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_1f416d05	f	That's crappy.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	373
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_21e63020	f	I knew I shouldn't have gotten out of bed this morning.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	374
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_534fd462	f	[prompt]	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	382
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_2a757253	f	That's a plan I can get behind!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	385
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_70359e00	f	So, uh. If you don't mind me asking. What's it like being a psychic?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	386
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_0f06ee9a	f	You're the one who's psychic!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	389
whatsthisallabout_start_esper_1ccad775	f	Let's head out! This place has me a little rattled anyway.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	390
esper_needASecret_bcdf0bcd	f	Huh?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	395
esper_needASecret_ffa21210	f	That's a weird thing to need.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	396
esper_needASecret_fa791fbb	f	You need some way of convincing me to trust you?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	397
esper_needASecret_44ff7fca	f	But I already trust you, I think.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	398
esper_needASecret_158697a6	f	That's kind of worrying, you know. Asking me to trust you, when I already do.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	399
esper_needASecret_e1359973	f	It's one of those things that, when you say it, has basically the opposite effect you want.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	400
esper_needASecret_ce2f3bc2	f	Like saying 'I'm not crazy!' Have you ever noticed that?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	401
esper_needASecret_2d323ef1	f	But yeah. Are you worried that evil mind-soldiers will make me forget you or something?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	402
esper_needASecret_9aca349b	f	Wait, are {i}you{/i} going to make me forget you? Like in Men in Black?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	403
esper_needASecret_2909de9e	f	What exactly are you asking for here, and why?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	404
esper_needASecret_0fa38397	f	So you need, I don't know, some kind of thing you could tell me that would make me trust you, even if I didn't remember you?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	407
esper_needASecret_6bbce6ac	f	Like a kind of password, or shibboleth, or something?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	408
esper_needASecret_3b33aa51	f	Hmm. It would need to be something that I knew I hadn't told anyone. Or at least didn't remember telling anyone.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	409
esper_needASecret_1385ee95	f	Otherwise I'd probably end up thinking you were a creepy stalker or something.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	410
esper_needASecret_38c18154	f	I can be kind of paranoid sometimes.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	411
esper_needASecret_83865da7	f	Okay, let me think.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	412
esper_needASecret_c9d21356	f	Except...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	413
esper_needASecret_076b2b00	f	If you're really a mind reader... Why do you need me to tell you one?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	414
esper_needASecret_7102c46e	f	Can't you just read my mind again and find something?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	415
esper_needASecret_f8372e21	f	... Oh.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	422
esper_needASecret_84adde68	f	God, that's creepy.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	423
esper_needASecret_8b2f679d	f	But yes. I don't think I ever told anyone that was my name for it.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	424
esper_needASecret_0fa2b3c0	f	I was always too afraid Mom would find out. Too embarrassed to really talk about it.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	425
esper_needASecret_fef6321a	f	Heh. Well, as I said. I'm kind of paranoid sometimes.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	426
esper_needASecret_f012f592	f	That sounds... kind of suspicious.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	428
esper_needASecret_6a39d23c	f	That's a highly convenient time for your mental powers to suddenly konk out.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	429
esper_needASecret_139abe56	f	This whole thing feels really dubious.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	430
esper_needASecret_75318ffe	f	I want to trust you. I really do.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	431
esper_needASecret_e7aeb558	f	But everything about this feels like some kind of a setup.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	432
esper_needASecret_4303f264	f	I don't know how you guessed my numbers before, but something here doesn't add up.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	433
esper_needASecret_072c9198	f	Um. You're what?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	436
esper_needASecret_0df1f5e7	f	I'm not sure I'm cool with that.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	437
esper_needASecret_b674fb72	f	The idea of someone messing with my head like that, and editing my memories?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	438
esper_needASecret_eec6ef60	f	That's kind of not cool, you know?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	439
esper_needASecret_93bbc126	f	You're not really going to do that, are you?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	440
esper_needASecret_e7137498	f	That's an oddly specific 'hypothetical situation'.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	443
esper_needASecret_f1eeee8c	f	You know, you're really making me start to wonder if this whole thing isn't some kind of setup.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	444
esper_needASecret_0957fbed	f	I still don't know how you guessed my numbers, but everything since then makes me really suspicious.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	445
esper_needASecret_08ee210b	f	I think I'm done here tonight.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	446
esper_needASecret_39c7376b	f	I need to digest all of this.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	447
esper_needASecret_2a1ed3f1	f	We'll talk again tomorrow, I guess.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	448
whatsthisallabout_savegame_91f7fdc9	f	What is all this about?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	470
whatsthisallabout_savegame_dc882042	f	Oh. I guess that sucks for you.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	473
whatsthisallabout_savegame_8bb1004f	f	I'm... not sure if you're expecting me to feel sympathy here now, or what?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	474
whatsthisallabout_savegame_bdd60c33	f	So now that I didn't die, does that mean you win now?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	475
whatsthisallabout_savegame_b37a3c38	f	Well, let's make the best of it!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	480
whatsthisallabout_savegame_a2071966	f	I certainly support your goal of me not dying.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	481
whatsthisallabout_savegame_9ecf0675	f	What should we do?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	482
whatsthisallabout_savegame_51427be2	f	Roger that!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	485
whatsthisallabout_savegame_b7e85c19	f	Okay!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	488
whatsthisallabout_savegame_b9b9445f	f	Oh. Really?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	491
whatsthisallabout_savegame_04f165e9	f	That's kind of crappy.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	492
whatsthisallabout_savegame_75ad9deb	f	Will you reload and try again?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	493
whatsthisallabout_savegame_5075e20c	f	That's good.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	496
whatsthisallabout_savegame_36cc4b47	f	See you around, I guess?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	497
whatsthisallabout_savegame_d7d762ae	f	Oh. That's kind of a grim thing to say.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	499
whatsthisallabout_savegame_63a5a32f	f	You'll understand if I hope that you're actually lying to me, and this is some kind of trick, then, right?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	500
whatsthisallabout_savegame_a533dd71	f	And that I'm not actually going to die today?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	501
whatsthisallabout_savegame_30f41b07	f	Neat! Then do you know kung fu?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	506
whatsthisallabout_savegame_03b38e72	f	Do I look like a bunch of numbers in your Neo-vision?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	507
whatsthisallabout_savegame_b2a1671f	f	Do something cool, since you're The One!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	509
whatsthisallabout_savegame_96b5f632	f	Aww.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	512
whatsthisallabout_savegame_da0608a8	f	So then - what now?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	513
whatsthisallabout_savegame_57db0a00	f	You saved my life - did some kind of crazy mind-reading trick that you claim was done because you rebooted the universe.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	514
whatsthisallabout_savegame_accf5f5b	f	What comes next?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	515
whatsthisallabout_savegame_9d42d699	f	Oh. That's pretty morbid.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	518
whatsthisallabout_savegame_2215ba4c	f	Is that going to take you a while? Or...?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	519
whatsthisallabout_savegame_cd1075ab	f	Should I just finish my dinner while you do that?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	520
whatsthisallabout_savegame_f4042f51	f	Let me know if you find anything interesting, I guess...?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	521
whatsthisallabout_savegame_cd0f191c	f	Oh! Great!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	524
whatsthisallabout_savegame_9da4bffd	f	I've always wanted one of those.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	525
whatsthisallabout_savegame_b199fe8c	f	Oh. That's not good.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	528
whatsthisallabout_savegame_96b5f632_1	f	Aww.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	531
whatsthisallabout_savegame_a3f36b9a	f	Can you do {i}something{/i} cool, though?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	532
whatsthisallabout_savegame_8c92c873	f	You can't just do a crazy mind-reading trick like that, claim to be some magical universe-hacker, and then leave me hanging, you know?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	533
whatsthisallabout_savegame_4682b0b7	f	Or do I have to wait until I'm in trouble again, before you leap into action with your wire-fu karate skills?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	534
whatsthisallabout_savegame_5888a5c3	f	I wonder how long I'll have to wait.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	535
whatsthisallabout_savegame_5b31a686		The two of you leave the restaurant, and then you fly Felicia home, because you can fly, because you are a hacker and super awesome.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	538
whatsthisallabout_savegame_5f633294	f	Okay...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	541
whatsthisallabout_savegame_dcb25e94	f	What does that mean exactly?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	542
whatsthisallabout_savegame_f2fa777f	f	I mean, I've taken Philosophy 101. Sure, we could all be brains in jars, living simulations or whatever.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	543
whatsthisallabout_savegame_0a25864a	f	Or I guess, as you're saying, computer programs that only think that they're people.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	544
whatsthisallabout_savegame_64a6be42	f	But if the illusion is good enough that I can't tell - how does that affect me?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	545
whatsthisallabout_savegame_a10445a2	f	For that matter, how do you know that {i}you{/i} are even real?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	546
whatsthisallabout_savegame_a5fe4e05	f	Maybe you just think you're playing a game with me in it, and you're really part of a different game for someone else?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	547
whatsthisallabout_savegame_757d716e	f	What, your game has {i}buttons?{/i}	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	550
whatsthisallabout_savegame_c4649a77	f	The '90s called. They want their interfaces back!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	551
whatsthisallabout_savegame_da55d589	f	My game is state of the art, voice-activated, hyperthreaded real time reality-based gameplay.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	552
whatsthisallabout_savegame_6e46adad	f	Take that!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	553
whatsthisallabout_savegame_4bab2615	f	Hah!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	556
whatsthisallabout_savegame_eb6eb4bb	f	Oh yeah? Well... Uh... You don't even mean anything!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	559
whatsthisallabout_savegame_17b44c73	f	Hah. Well, I win at that, for what it's worth.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	563
whatsthisallabout_savegame_e9a0b76d	f	More exciting is usually good anyway.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	564
whatsthisallabout_savegame_03b6fe1f	f	After all, who wants to live a boring life?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	565
whatsthisallabout_savegame_e199655b	f	No, I think you are.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	568
whatsthisallabout_savegame_411efe67	f	Nuh uh, it's you.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	573
whatsthisallabout_savegame_37189270	f	No, I'm pretty sure you are.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	578
whatsthisallabout_savegame_de09b3be	f	No, you're the one in a game.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	583
whatsthisallabout_savegame_dd05b25a	f	No, {i}you're{/i} on {i}my{/i} screen right now.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	588
whatsthisallabout_savegame_8a6d3d02	f	No, {i}you{/i} don't have a game. You're in my screen. That I'm playing. To the end. Or whatever.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	593
whatsthisallabout_savegame_a725a79d	f	No, {i}you're{/i} the one in the game. You can tell.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	598
whatsthisallabout_savegame_ce93b9cf	f	No, now {i}you're{/i} just trying to be annoying.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	603
whatsthisallabout_savegame_2ad54d20	f	No, you stop copying me!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	608
whatsthisallabout_savegame_0836c73a	f	No, you're stupid.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	613
whatsthisallabout_savegame_4bab2615_1	f	Hah!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	615
whatsthisallabout_savegame_a3df4e9a	f	But didn't you already do that?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	619
whatsthisallabout_savegame_71fc4db7	f	You already saved my life tonight.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	620
whatsthisallabout_savegame_2185c7eb	f	Aren't we in the clear now?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	622
whatsthisallabout_savegame_d41d41b5	f	Oh, that's good.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	625
whatsthisallabout_savegame_61d20eb4	f	Hah. So you get to experience this fresh, like the rest of us mortals?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	628
whatsthisallabout_savegame_46308ec5	f	Well, guess we'll see what happens next.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	629
whatsthisallabout_savegame_6ff7004b	f	What's our next move?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	630
whatsthisallabout_savegame_125287aa	f	Okay.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	633
whatsthisallabout_savegame_3977cdf9	f	I might be feeling too nervous to finish my dinner now.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	634
whatsthisallabout_savegame_829ac094	f	But that's probably the least of my concerns now, huh?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	635
whatsthisallabout_savegame_5b5149e9	f	Okay, let's go.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	638
whatsthisallabout_savegame_a9490010	f	You've got me all spooked now!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	639
whatsthisallabout_savegame_561cecce	f	Oh.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	642
whatsthisallabout_savegame_04f165e9_1	f	That's kind of crappy.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	643
whatsthisallabout_savegame_15074360	f	Oh. What should we do, then?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	646
whatsthisallabout_savegame_79d17bb7	f	Do you know somewhere safer?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	647
whatsthisallabout_savegame_76ceb2bf	f	Huh. That leaves me kind of screwed, doesn't it.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	654
whatsthisallabout_savegame_c1b93561	f	So what's your plan, then?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	655
whatsthisallabout_savegame_faa5c693	f	I wish I could afford to be that passive.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	658
whatsthisallabout_savegame_1079d10e	f	Actually, you know what? You're full of it.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	659
whatsthisallabout_savegame_c01a0ff9	f	You expect me to believe that you know I'm going to die, and that now you're just going to sit and watch?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	660
whatsthisallabout_savegame_0f2737f8	f	This {i}has{/i} to be a joke. I know you. That's not you.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	661
whatsthisallabout_savegame_fcc8d573	f	If I were actually about to die, you wouldn't just be sitting there!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	662
whatsthisallabout_savegame_8fbcc2cc	f	You'd be {i}doing{/i} something. You're taking this all way too calmly to be real.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	663
whatsthisallabout_savegame_d22f8b81	f	What kind of a person could sit and watch someone die so emotionlessly?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	664
whatsthisallabout_savegame_44108ee4	f	This was a pretty dirty trick.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	665
whatsthisallabout_savegame_90bb8f4f	f	So? I'm right, aren't I?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	666
whatsthisallabout_savegame_f9d3dca4	f	Oh. I was hoping for something more, I don't know...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	676
whatsthisallabout_savegame_9a689c3b	f	Proactive.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	677
whatsthisallabout_savegame_561cecce_1	f	Oh.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	680
whatsthisallabout_savegame_b98c7748	f	I guess that sounds reasonable.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	681
whatsthisallabout_savegame_907149fc	f	I'm not totally happy about the 'me dying' part of this plan.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	682
whatsthisallabout_savegame_889e1f00	f	Heck, I'm still not totally sure this isn't some stupid trick you're playing.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	683
whatsthisallabout_savegame_a1ea0e2f	f	Like, I'll get all convinced that I'm about to die, and then you'll shout 'Surprise!' and I get to feel like an idiot.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	684
whatsthisallabout_savegame_2baae9ee	f	I... kind of hope that's it, honestly.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	685
whatsthisallabout_savegame_209ed468	f	It's fun to imagine that my life just got a lot more exciting.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	686
whatsthisallabout_savegame_84305749	f	But it's not very fun to imagine that my life just got a lot more short.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	687
whatsthisallabout_savegame_39404f92	f	Let me know if you find any clues, okay?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	688
whatsthisallabout_savegame_561cecce_2	f	Oh.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	691
whatsthisallabout_savegame_1e2868de	f	That sucks.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	692
whatsthisallabout_savegame_34fb8cfd	f	Well, I guess in that case I don't have to feel guilty about ordering dessert, at least.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	693
whatsthisallabout_savegame_d69811f8	f	Hey, this isn't some trick or something, is it?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	694
whatsthisallabout_savegame_c730854a	f	I mean, the part where you saved my life, and then knew what word I was thinking of was kind of convincing.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	695
whatsthisallabout_savegame_7d2f1399	f	But I'm going to be kind of mad if it turns out that I blew my diet for nothing.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	696
whatsthisallabout_savegame_231b3efb	f	Hahaha! Seriously? You're serious?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	700
whatsthisallabout_savegame_3efbf6a4	f	What in the world were you doing to make me think you were a stalker?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	701
whatsthisallabout_savegame_055bf734	f	Ahh, yeah, that makes sense.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	704
whatsthisallabout_savegame_24b3f82c	f	I {i}am{/i} pretty paranoid, and if you dumped that on me all at once, I'd probably freak out.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	705
whatsthisallabout_savegame_c1feefb1	f	I mean, I'm kind of freaked out as it is, but I think I'm at least to the point where I'm willing to accept that {i}something{/i} weird is going down, you know?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	706
whatsthisallabout_savegame_85c69ae1	f	Hehe. You must have done something {i}really{/i} embarrassing if you don't want to talk about it.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	708
whatsthisallabout_savegame_84ebd001	f	Okay, I'll play along. Not important.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	709
whatsthisallabout_savegame_bd6a4025	f	So I guess the trick is, how do you convince me to trust you in a hurry?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	711
whatsthisallabout_savegame_a8c6dd90	f	That's kind of a tough one.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	712
whatsthisallabout_savegame_58024f4a	f	I guess you'd need to be able to tell me something nonthreatening, but also mysterious enough to pique my interest.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	713
whatsthisallabout_savegame_5811fc15	f	So even if I wasn't sure how you did it, I'd be interested enough to play along, huh?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	714
whatsthisallabout_savegame_f2b71567	f	And if I'm calling you a crazy stalker, then it would need to be something that you couldn't possibly know, even if you {i}were{/i} stalking me.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	715
whatsthisallabout_savegame_24bb6b35	f	So... Hmm.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	716
needASecret_general_91c45043	f	Let me think...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	730
needASecret_general_a7819760	f	....	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	731
needASecret_general_a2efc8d1	f	...........	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	732
needASecret_general_97ceff64	f	Hmm. This is hard.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	733
needASecret_general_5b499500	f	You mean eleventeen ninety-dozen? How did you know about that?!?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	736
needASecret_general_92db0450	f	That would work, but I was talking about it with Mom just last week.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	737
needASecret_general_3ec57d49	f	...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	738
needASecret_general_b2160662	f	I'll try to come up with something else.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	739
needASecret_general_96587085	f	Seriously?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	741
needASecret_general_c6f4e2b1	f	I can't tell if you're joking or not.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	742
needASecret_general_b9765480		She shows you her backpack.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	743
needASecret_general_8b36ff0f		On the back, you can see now it has hand-embroidered letters, reading 'Macho Man Randy Savage 4-ever'	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	744
needASecret_general_3ec57d49_1	f	...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	745
needASecret_general_c0d9fe51	f	Sorry. Yeah, that one wouldn't be too hard for someone to guess.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	746
needASecret_general_6409934a	f	I'll see if I can't think of something better.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	747
needASecret_general_f0cd95d6	f	Hmm. No, my parents knew about that. That won't work.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	749
needASecret_general_7e5b5d1e	f	I think they even have an embarrassing photo of that whole evening.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	750
needASecret_general_78145994	f	It's of me, on a gurney in an oxygen mask. I remember it took a lot of explaining to convince me that the oxygen tube wasn't my elephant trunk.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	751
needASecret_general_9f20840f	f	I'll keep thinking about it.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	752
needASecret_general_efc3f125	f	Hmm. No, I don't think that would work. I wrote about most of that in my diary.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	754
needASecret_general_e38ac6ec	f	And of course Mom and I talked about... Dad... quite a bit after he left.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	755
needASecret_general_2df2c339	f	Sorry. I'll keep thinking.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	756
needASecret_general_8c3907b5	f	Hmm...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	757
needASecret_general_44df2cc3	f	Hmm. No, I don't think that would work. I actually had Mom proofread my letter and help me mail it.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	759
needASecret_general_3ec57d49_2	f	...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	760
needASecret_general_c9d21356	f	Except...	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	761
needASecret_general_da2b5684	f	I {i}do{/i} remember that I thought the entrance to Hogwarts was up on Moore's Hill, up outside of town.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	762
needASecret_general_162cfab3	f	Since there aren't any trains around here, you know. I couldn't get in at the train station.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	763
needASecret_general_fa20fd5e	f	So I think I convinced myself that they'd have to come pick me up by airlift, like in one of their magic flying cars or something.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	764
needASecret_general_bdb3a888	f	I always imagined myself standing up on the hill in one of those ridiculous scarfs, and Hagrid or someone swooping down, and carrying me off to a magical place where I could fix everything.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	765
needASecret_general_736cac92	f	I don't think that was ever important enough that I ever told anyone about it.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	766
needASecret_general_284380e3	f	But I'm pretty sure that if you asked me about 'the local Hogwarts pickup stop', I'd know what you mean.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	767
needASecret_general_229175e5	f	And be really curious about how {i}you{/i} knew.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	769
needASecret_general_90a1ee18	f	Will that work?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	770
needASecret_general_8247c748	f	Yay! I'm glad I could help!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	773
needASecret_general_a5ed765c	f	So this will help save my life?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	774
needASecret_general_6aa01560	f	I hope it works!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	777
needASecret_general_f5a880c3	f	I mean, obviously, I guess.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	778
needASecret_general_0df250f2	f	Tell me if there is anything else I can do!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	779
needASecret_general_b0a91d6f	f	Oh wow, that takes me back.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	782
needASecret_general_9858e0f9	f	Wow, how did you even know about that?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	783
needASecret_general_c0b4a088	f	Oh. Right. You're a... Yeah, never mind.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	784
needASecret_general_45973161	f	Okay, let me think. Yeah, I think that should work. I'm pretty sure that was never important enough to ever write down, even in my diary.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	785
needASecret_general_b6575b41	f	And I certainly would have been too embarrassed to mention it to anyone.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	786
needASecret_general_94eb9507	f	I'm positive I never told anyone about it. Heck, I don't think I've even ever really thought about it for years.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	788
needASecret_general_6c26544d	f	That's really creepy, though, how you just magicked it out of my head like that.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	789
needASecret_general_b0332f5a	f	This evening has been pretty weird, so I think I'm just sort of taking these things in stride now.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	790
needASecret_general_22595b50	f	But if you'd mentioned that out of the blue {i}before{/i} we went and had ourselves such a surreal dining experience, that would have really freaked me out, you know?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	791
needASecret_general_75da1652	f	You've done some crazy stuff tonight, you know?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	792
needASecret_general_81deba2d	f	If you need to get me to trust you, or at the very least, pique my interest, that should do the trick.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	795
needASecret_general_119449f7	f	I mean, I already trust you now. Moreso after the whole life-saving bit.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	796
needASecret_general_534fd462	f	[prompt]	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	798
needASecret_general_8247c748_1	f	Yay! I'm glad I could help!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	801
needASecret_general_a5ed765c_1	f	So this will help save my life?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	802
needASecret_general_72ffcd19	f	Cool! I'm glad I could help!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	805
needASecret_general_0df250f2_1	f	Tell me if there is anything else I can do!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	806
needASecret_general_f89d02c2	f	Maybe... Oh, I've got an idea!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	809
needASecret_general_74644c96	f	I had a sort of secret name for one of my favorite places, actually. It's up on Moore's Hill, outside of town?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	810
needASecret_general_daef1f92	f	I don't think I ever told anyone this, but in my head, at least, I always called it the 'local Hogwarts pickup stop'.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	811
needASecret_general_6440ab2e	f	I... may... have had fantasies about being carried off to Hogwarts when I was little.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	813
needASecret_general_47d138cc	f	Don't judge me!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	814
needASecret_general_393da278	f	Anyway, I'm nearly positive I never told anyone about it.	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	815
needASecret_general_23eb3f33	f	Will that do?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	816
needASecret_general_8247c748_2	f	Yay! I'm glad I could help!	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	819
needASecret_general_a5ed765c_2	f	So this will help save my life?	game/whatsthisabout.rpy	820

dinnerStart_tacos_e652d384	f	This was a good idea. Everything is better with tacos!	game/tacos.rpy	6
dinnerStart_tacos_33a09c1e	f	I've heard good things about this place, and I hear they got a new chef recently, too!	game/tacos.rpy	7
dinnerStart_tacos_251f3ce6	f	And I really like how they're out on the docks like this! It's like we're eating right on the water!	game/tacos.rpy	8
dinnerStart_tacos_90c6f179	f	Where do you want to sit?	game/tacos.rpy	11
dinnerStart_tacos_fcc85c0a		The tables outside are popular, but your server manages to find a free one for the two of you.	game/tacos.rpy	14
dinnerStart_tacos_92d560ec		You take your seats and start looking at the menu.	game/tacos.rpy	15
dinnerStart_tacos_aa436d0e		The two of you sit down at a table near a giant window, where you can look out over the water.	game/tacos.rpy	18
dinnerStart_tacos_b6abe3ab		The sun is just starting to set, and the waves are turning gold-colored. The effect is quite beautiful.	game/tacos.rpy	19
dinnerStart_tacos_eb5f8350		You are directed to a booth, and the server brings out water and menus.	game/tacos.rpy	21
dinnerStart_tacos_8378ff56	f	Okay, let's have some tacos! Do you have any recommendations?	game/tacos.rpy	24
dinnerStart_tacos_1cc79003	f	I hear their fish tacos are amazing, but I'm open to other options.	game/tacos.rpy	25
dinnerStart_tacos_1c8409e3	f	What are you going to get?	game/tacos.rpy	28
dinnerStart_tacos_007bd880	f	You've convinced me! I'll have them too!	game/tacos.rpy	31
dinnerStart_tacos_0fa39935	f	Hmm. Tempting.	game/tacos.rpy	34
dinnerStart_tacos_1d9a0ab2	f	But not tempting enough! Fish tacos for me, please!	game/tacos.rpy	35
dinnerStart_tacos_bf8652cc	f	Mmm. I do like mango!	game/tacos.rpy	39
dinnerStart_tacos_36151081	f	But no. I entered this dinner with a resolution to eat fish tacos.	game/tacos.rpy	40
dinnerStart_tacos_962bb24e	f	What would you think of me if I cast aside my ambitions so lightly?!	game/tacos.rpy	41
dinnerStart_tacos_365620a2	f	Fish tacos, please!	game/tacos.rpy	42
dinnerStart_tacos_a16fe5ba	f	Haha. I hope I don't sound obsessed to you. But for some reason I'm just really excited about tacos tonight!	game/tacos.rpy	45
dinnerStart_tacos_33f20572	f	I'm not normally this obsessive! Honest!	game/tacos.rpy	46
dinnerStart_tacos_0077aa8f	f	Do you ever get like that? Obsess over some particular thing you want, to the exclusion of everything else?	game/tacos.rpy	48
dinnerStart_tacos_08ce3de1	f	Haha, yeah, I guess.	game/tacos.rpy	55
dinnerStart_tacos_3c4ab138	f	Oh! What's that?	game/tacos.rpy	56
dinnerStart_tacos_5236b6af		She points out the window.	game/tacos.rpy	57
dinnerStart_tacos_e1784040	f	Are those dolphins?! I think those are dolphins!	game/tacos.rpy	58
dinnerStart_tacos_ca6902df		You follow her as she runs to the railing to look out over the ocean.	game/tacos.rpy	59
dinnerStart_tacos_f7041ba3	f	It is dolphins! Oh, I'm so glad we came here tonight! This is so awesome!	game/tacos.rpy	60
dinnerStart_tacos_5b8c1f19	f	Have you ever seen anything quite like it?	game/tacos.rpy	62
dinnerStart_tacos_2e88bc64		She gazes out at the picturesque scene for a moment longer, and then several things happen all at once.	game/tacos.rpy	73
dinnerStart_tacos_60b81d86	f	Woah! What's happening?!	game/tacos.rpy	74
dinnerStart_tacos_468e41df		Too quickly for you to react, and yet somehow with agonizing slowness, the railing, and in fact the whole patio, collapses into the sea.	game/tacos.rpy	75
dinnerStart_tacos_a8679a94		Felicia tries to jump for safety as soon as she feels everything begin to move, but she's not quite quick enough. You lose sight of her in the churning water amidst all the debris from the deck.	game/tacos.rpy	76
dinnerStart_tacos_911e0481		That was the last time you saw her. The currents near there are known to be treacherous, and they never did manage to find a body.	game/tacos.rpy	79
howDidYouKnow_tacos_b0d3c18f		She turns around, obviously a bit surprised at your tone, but obediently takes a step to the left.	game/tacos.rpy	84
howDidYouKnow_tacos_1209a417	f	What, was I in the way, or HOLY CRAP	game/tacos.rpy	85
howDidYouKnow_tacos_c9eafbb9		The portion of the deck where she was just standing abruptly collapses into the water.	game/tacos.rpy	86
howDidYouKnow_tacos_630093a3	f	I... I was almost standing there. I... Holy crap, that was close.	game/tacos.rpy	87
howDidYouKnow_tacos_45dcec97	f	I could have died!	game/tacos.rpy	88
waitedTooLong_tacos_df26e610		Suddenly, you're interrupted by screams and the sound of a lot of things breaking.	game/tacos.rpy	96
waitedTooLong_tacos_961e76f3		Your first thought is that suddenly there are snakes everywhere!	game/tacos.rpy	97
waitedTooLong_tacos_4f4d8137		Soon enough, though, you realize your mistake. It's actually just tentacles.	game/tacos.rpy	98
waitedTooLong_tacos_d339c7ea		Countless tentacles, coming in from every window and opening, boiling up from the rolling waters beneath the restaurant.	game/tacos.rpy	99
waitedTooLong_tacos_02192e8c		Not snakes at all, you think to yourself, as Felicia is pulled out a window, with a tentacle wrapped around her, over a foot in diameter.	game/tacos.rpy	100
waitedTooLong_tacos_aea5083e		Just a sea monster.	game/tacos.rpy	102
